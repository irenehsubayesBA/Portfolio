# Acedamics Projects

1. **Insurance Fault Detection Using Unsupervised Sequential Anomaly Detection**

- Utilised deep learning models, including autoencoders, using Python (TensorFlow & Keras) to detect patterns and anomalies in insurance datasets, leading to improved risk assessment

2. **Data-Driven Integration Planning at Societe Francaise de Biotechnologie (SFB)**

- Implemented machine learning models such as logistic regression and PCA using Python (Scikit-learn) to identify patterns and provide predictive modelling for decision-making processes on integration planning

- Developed optimization models to minimize costs associated with offering RCC agreements to eligible employees, resulting in significant cost savings (30%) for the company

3. **Applied Research Project: Refining Personalisation in the Luxury Automotive Industry: How Customer Preferences and Perceptions Can Shape Maseratiâ€™s Configuration Strategy**
   
- Conducted luxury customers perception analysis by using topic modeling and sentiment analysis to discover their preferences and perceptions of personalised experience

- Identified Maserati's opportunities for enhancing their infotainment innovation and sustainable materials offerings and proposed the integration of predictive maintenance as part of Maserati's configuration strategy
