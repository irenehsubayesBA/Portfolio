Range-topping variants will likely receive the firm's own V12 engine.", "Aston will build the Varekai in a brand-new facility located in Wales. Sales are tentatively scheduled to begin next year, meaning the production model could be just a few short months away from breaking cover. The segment will very quickly become very crowded.", "When it lands, the Aston Martin Varekai will compete in the same segment as the Lamborghini Urus and the Bentley Bentayga. Upcoming rivals include the Rolls-Royce Cullinan, which will break cover by the end of the year, and Ferrari's first SUV, which we might not see until the early 2020s.
