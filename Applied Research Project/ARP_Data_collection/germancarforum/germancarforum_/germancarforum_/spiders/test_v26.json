Engineers from every development department have worked together to optimise assemblies and components, to save fuel by means of reduced weight, a new form, improved functioning or efficient energy management.", "The work done in the wind tunnel was particularly successful, for with a drag coefficient of only 0.25, the new E-Class is the world’s most aerodynamically efficient luxury saloon. It betters the already good Cd figure of the preceding model by another four percent, which represents a fuel saving of around 0.25 litres per 100 kilometres when driving at a motorway speed of 130 km/h. The aerodynamics are for example improved by variable fan louvres, which control the airflow to the engine compartment in line with requirements.", "Other BlueEFFICIENCY measures include newly developed tyres with up to 17 percent lower rolling resistance, energy-saving control of the generator, fuel pump, air conditioning compressor and power steering, and the ECO start/stop functionwhich switches the engine of the new E 200 CGIoff when idling. Displays in the speedometer inform the driver how much fuel is being consumed (per 100 kilometres), and when he should shift to the next higher gear in the interests of an economical and environmentally conscious style of driving.", "The range of engines available for the new E-Class comprises four, six and eight-cylinder units with outputs from 100 kW/136 hp to 386 kW/525 hp. The four-cylinder engines are newly developed direct-injection units, which develop a higher output and torque than the comparable V6-engines of the preceding series despite a smaller displacement. The strategy is to replace to replace large, naturally aspirated engines with turbocharged units which excel with advantages such as lower weight, reduced internal friction and more economical operating characteristics.", "With three completely newly developed four-cylinder engines, the E-Class also remains one generation ahead where diesel technology is concerned. These engines feature latest-generation common-rail direct injection, fast piezo-electric injectors, improved exhaust gas recirculation and an innovative twin turbocharger, making for fast responsiveness and good performance characteristics. To express this in figures, the E 250 CDI with 150 kW/204 hp and 500 newton metres develops a 25 percent higher torque than the previous V6 diesel engine, but uses around 23 percent less fuel at only 5.3 litres per 100 kilometres (combined NEDC consumption). This corresponds to 139 grams of CO2per kilometre.", "The new four-cylinder diesel engine also powers the E 220 CDI with 125 kW/ 170 hp and the E 200 CDI with 100 kW/136 hp, also with a fuel consumption of only 5.3 litres per 100 kilometres.", "The top model in the new E-Class diesel range is the six-cylinder E 350 CDI with an output of 170 kW/231 hp, which uses 0.5 litres per 100 kilometres less fuel than the previous E 320 CDI. From autumn 2009 the V6 diesel will also be available as a BlueTEC model with the world’s best emission control technology. The E 350 BlueTEC develops 155 kW/211 hp and meets the EU6 exhaust emission standards planned for 2014. All the other engine variants in the new E-Class meet the EU5 limits.", "The E 200 CGI and E 250 CGIare equipped with the newly developed four-cylinder direct-injection engine with a displacement of 1.8 litres, turbocharging and variable intake and exhaust camshafts. The E 200 CGI(135 kW/184 hp) is equipped with a six-speed manual transmission and the ECOstart/stop function as standard, and consumes only 6.8 litres of premium petrol per 100 kilometres (combined NEDC consumption, provisional figure). This equates to 159 grams of CO2per kilometre.", "In the E 250 CGI(150 kW/204 hp), which has a five-speed automatic transmission as standard, maximum torque is now 310 newton metres, which represents an increase of more than 26 percent over the previous V6-engine. At the same time the NEDC fuel consumption is reduced by over 20 percent to 7.4 litres per 100 kilometres, equating to 175 grams of CO2per kilometre (provisional figures).", "As before, the E 350 CGI with direct petrol injection (215 kW/292 hp) and the top-of-the-line E 500 (285 kW/388 hp) are included in the range of engine variants in the new E-Class. Detailed improvements have reduced the fuel consumption of these V6/V8 models by up to 0.6 litres per 100 kilometres. As a product from Mercedes-AMG, the new high-performance E 63 AMG develops 386 kW/525 hp.", "The V6 and V8-models are equipped with a seven-speed automatic transmission and steering wheel selector lever as standard.", "On request the V6 models E 350 CDIand E 350, as well as the eight-cylinder E 500, are available with latest-generation Mercedes all-wheel drive. This system distinguishes itself from previous all-wheel drive technology with greater efficiency, lower weight and more compact construction. These advantages produce noticeably better traction and fuel savings.", "For more than 50 years, the saloons in the E-Class and their predecessors have been acknowledged as trendsetters in the safety field. The new saloon continues this tradition with an unrivalled combination of the very latest assistance and protection system whose concept and development are based on what actually happens during accidents. These technologies make the E-Class an \"intelligent partner\"who can see, feel, react reflexively in critical situations and if necessary act independently to prevent accidents or mitigate their consequences. With this concept the new Mercedes model not only protects its own occupants, but also contributes decisively to the greater safety of other road users.", "The new E-Class is the first automobile in the world whose headlamps adapt to the traffic situation and respond automatically to avoid dazzling other drivers. The optional Adaptive Main Beam Assist uses a camera on the windscreen to recognise oncoming traffic and vehicles moving ahead, and controls the headlamps so that their beams do not reach the other vehicle. This achieves the best possible road illumination in a given situation. The range of the dipped headlamp beams can be extended from 65 to up to 300 metres. If the road ahead is clear, the system performs a gentle transition to high beam.", "Mercedes-Benz offers this new system as a light & sight package that includes", "bi-xenon headlamps, the Intelligent Light System and LED daytime driving lights.", "The Lane Safety package for the new E-Class includes Blind Spot Assist familiar from the S-Class, and as a new development, Lane Keeping Assist which seeks to prevent the vehicle from leaving the road unintentionally. When the system recognises that the car is drifting from its lane, the driver is prompted to take countersteering action by brief but unmistakable vibrations of the steering wheel. The images from the windscreen camera are also used by the new, optionally available Speed Limit Assist , which recognises speed limit signs as the car passes them, then displays the relevant speed limit in the speedometer.", "Night View Assist from the S-Class is now also available as an optional extra for the new E-Class. Mercedes-Benz has improved this system with a special pedestrian detection function: as soon as Night View Assist Plus recognises pedestrians ahead of the car, they are highlighted in the onboard display to provide a greatly enhanced warning effect.", "Thanks to an innovative technology, the new E-Class has developed a highly sensitive means of monitoring its driver’s attention level, and warns him of drowsiness in good time. This new ATTENTION ASSIST drowsiness detection system, which is standard equipment, is equipped with highly sensitive sensors that continuously monitor more than 70 different parameters. Observing the driver’s steering behaviour has proved to be a particularly strong indicator: several years of practical research by Mercedes engineers have shown that drowsy drivers make minor steering errors that can often be rapidly corrected in characteristic ways. These corrections are recognised by a highly sensitive steering angle sensor.", "The well-proven, radar based assistance systems from the S-Class are now also optionally available to E-Class customers. A further development of the long-range radar sensor now has a range of 200 metres (previously 150 metres), and is able to monitor the mid-distance so that dynamic events such as a vehicle ahead suddenly pulling out to overtake can be detected even more effectively. The two wide-angle short-range radar sensors, which have a range of around 30 metres, continue to be included in the system.", "The radar-supported systems are able to assist the driver with emergency braking. Their sensors are linked to the Brake Assist PLUS system, which automatically calculates the braking pressure to prevent a collision in critical situations. The driver is given an acoustic and visual warning at the same time. When the brake pedal is depressed, the system immediately activates the calculated level of braking assistance.", "If the driver fails to respond to the warnings, the radar system first initiates partial braking action. As a second stage, if there is still no driver response and a collision is unavoidable, emergency braking is initiated. This can considerably lessen the severity of an accident, i.e. the system acts as something like an \"electronic crumple zone\".", "During the course of its development, the new E-Class was subjected to more", "than 150 high-speed crash tests and a total of more than 17,000 realistic crash simulations. The crumple zone principle invented by the Mercedes safety pioneer Béla Barényi has been continuously improved by the engineers in Sindelfingen. The front-end deformation zone of the E-Class acts on four independent levels, and is even more effective than before. The increased use of highest-strength steel alloys also helps to ensure that the bodyshell is able to withstand high impact forces. Around 72 percent of all the body panels are made from these high-tech steels – yet another unrivalled figure in passenger car development.", "With seven airbags as standard, belt tensioners, belt force limiters, crash-responsive head restraints and ISOFIX child seat attachments, the new E-Class has even more extensive safety features than the preceding model. Another new feature is the active bonnet, which is a continuation of many years of commitment to pedestrian protection on the part of Mercedes-Benz. It is standard equipment in the new E-Class. In the event of an impact, a system of springs raises the rear section of the bonnet by 50 millimetres within fractions of a second, thereby increasing the available deformation space. Thanks to the cleverly conceived mechanism, the driver is able to reset the active bonnet to its normal position himself, without visiting a workshop.", "Another standard feature is the preventive occupant protection system PRE-SAFE®. In potentially hazardous situations this reflexively activates precautionary protective measures for the vehicle occupants, so that the seat belts and airbags are able to fulfil their protective function to the full during an impact.", "As in the safety field, the E-Class has been setting the standards for long-distance comfort in this vehicle class for several decades. Bettering the already high level of the preceding series, Mercedes engineers have achieved further advances with the new saloon – especially where ride, seating and climatic comfort are concerned.", "Standard equipment includes a further improved suspension with adaptive shock absorbers. These automatically adapt to the current driving situation by reducing the damping forces when driving normally, thereby noticeably improving ride comfort. When taking bends at speed or during rapid evasive action, the system switches to the maximum damping effect so that the saloon is stabilised to best effect.", "A version with dynamic damping characteristics and a lowered suspension is available as an optional alternative to the standard suspension (standard for the AVANTGARDE line).", "The air suspension system optionally available for the V6 models (standard", "in the E 500/E 500 4MATIC) has for the first time been combined with an electronically controlled damping system, which processes various sensor signals and controls each wheel independently. In this way Mercedes specialists have achieved significantly better ride comfort while improving handling safety and agility at the same time. The driver is able to select either comfort or sport mode at the touch of a button.", "Where seat development is concerned, Mercedes-Benz had added a new quality to a well established Mercedes concept, namely padded seat piping –", "a sophisticated and demanding upholstery technique that is only used by Mercedes-Benz. This involves the insertion of an additional foam filling under the fabric or leather cover, and gives an immediate feeling of comfort and wellbeing when sitting in the car. There are different versions of this padded seat piping: in the basic model and AVANTGARDE line the upholstery is transversely contoured, while the ELEGANCE line has longitudinal piping and is reminiscent of the well-known and highly effective Mercedes seat design from the 1960s and 70s.", "The active multicontour seat package (optional) includes newly developed multicontour seats with comfort head restraints and a two-stage massage function in the backrest that has proven highly successful in the S-Class. Depending on the steering angle, lateral acceleration and vehicle speed, fast-acting piezo-electric valves on the air chambers in the backrests vary their pressure and volume to give the driver and front passenger even better lateral support.", "On request the E-Class is also available with a rear seat unit consisting of two comfortable, single seats. This rear-seat comfort package includes seat heating, leather upholstery, a centre console, comfort head restraints, roller blinds in the rear doors, an electrically operated roller blind for the rear window, comfort sun visors and a through-loading facility to the boot.", "Mercedes-Benz has developed a climate control system for the E-Class which not only allows individual temperatures to be set in three zones – for the driver, front passenger and rear passengers – but also offers different \"climatisation modes\". If this optional THERMOTRONIC system is specified, the occupants of the new E‑Class are able to select \"Diffuse\", \"Medium\"or \"Focus\"at the touch of a button, and adapt the air volume and distribution to their personal preferences without sacrificing the convenience of automatic mode. In standard trim the new E-Class is equipped with the two-zone THERMATIC automatic climate control system.", "In 1995 the E-Class was the first Mercedes model to appear with the highly acclaimed twin-headlamp face – a highly symbolic design feature that still characterises the identity of the E-Class. Nonetheless, the design idiom has remained fluent even for this characteristic styling feature, and has been adapted to suit the self-assured, masculine overall appearance of the saloon. The designers have now reinterpreted these four \"eyes\"as rectangles, with a direct reference to the interesting geometrical shapes found in cubism. They have the effect of precious gems that have been precisely set into the wings. In the same way, the radiator grille with its three-dimensional chromed surround, dynamic arrow-shape and more upright position underlines the status of the car as the epitome of a business saloon.", "A sophisticated interplay between lines and surfaces is one of the hallmarks of today’s Mercedes design. Large concave or convex surface areas are structured by taut, clearly defined lines. This design concept has been perfected down to the last detail in the new E-Class. The flank contours become connecting features that influence the entire body design, i.e. not just the side aspects but also the front and rear-end styling.", "At the rear this harmonious flow culminates in a new feature, namely a graceful line that follows the rear wheel arches and lends a clear shape to the imposing, muscular contours of the rear wings. Here Mercedes aficionados will recognise styling features reminiscent of the famous \"Ponton Mercedes\" introduced in 1953, which already emphasised its sovereign character with these striking", "contours at the time -- a symbolic feature, and at the same time a hallmark of the E-Class that well illustrates how tradition is made to harmonise with the future in this model series.", "With typical Mercedes attention to detail, the designers have also given great attention to the interior of the new E-Class, ensuring that every feature appeals in both emotional and functional terms with its form, colour or material. The result is a harmonious whole – an atmosphere in which the car’s occupants immediately feel safe and protected, and long journeys can be taken without any feeling of effort or stress. In short: Typically E-Class, welcome home.", "Individuality and variety have always been two of the outstanding attributes of the E-Class. The new saloon not only provides Mercedes customers with a choice of ten engines and three suspension variants, but also two design and equipment lines, 12 wheel/tyre combinations in 16, 17, 18 or 19-inch size, twelve exterior paint finishes and six different seat upholstery materials in up to five colour combinations to suit their individual preferences. The choice of interior trim has been doubled versus the preceding series, with the range now including high-gloss exotic wood, open-pored wood and aluminium trim.", "Standard specifications already include 16-inch light-alloy wheels in a nine-spoke design, eucalyptus or embossed aluminium trim (optional) and a four-spoke multifunction steering wheel lined in fine nappa leather with chrome inserts. Also included in the standard equipment is the Audio 20 CD infotainment system with a twin receiver, CD-player, eight loudspeakers and a Bluetooth interface for a mobile phone. The colour display in the centre of the dashboard can be operated by the driver or front passenger, using the Controller on the centre console.", "The individualisation programme for the E-Class is based on two design and equipment lines. The ELEGANCE line lives up to its name with a decidedly elegant, classic appearance. This is in part due to additional features such as a chrome-plated radiator grille with four silver-painted louvres, 16-inch light-alloy wheels in a ten twin-spoke design, burr walnut trim and stylish ambient lighting with fibre optics that frame the dashboard and door panels.", "In contrast the AVANTGARDE line shows the E-Class in a decidedly modern and innovative light. This is ensured by additional standard features such as bi-xenon headlamps with the Intelligent Light System and LED daytime driving lights, LED technology for all the rear lights, 17-inch light-alloy wheels in a five twin-spoke design, a special, lowered suspension setup, ambient lighting and the instrument cluster in a sporty tubular design. This model variant is also distinguishable by its different bumper design and a chrome-plated radiator grille with three glossy, black louvres.", "In addition to the design and equipment lines, the AMGsports package and the Exclusive package offer more scope for equipping the new E-Class to personal taste. These packages contain high-quality features that are mostly not available in isolation.", "In the AMG sports packagethey include bumpers and side skirts in an AMGdesign, sport seats with enhanced lateral support, contrasting decorative seams in the seats and armrests, a three-spoke sports steering wheel with shift paddles, a black roof lining, a lowered sports suspension , perforated disc brakes with the Mercedes logo and 18-inch light-alloy wheels in an AMGdesign.", "The Exclusive package includes a wood/leather steering wheel, the roof lining, pillar claddings and sun visors in Alcantara, the seat upholstery, armrest and door panels in nappa leather, an attractively lined dashboard with decorative seams and velours floor mats.", "The new E-Class saloon is the successor to a Mercedes model that has been successful throughout the world, and of which more than 1.3 million examples have been sold since 2002. In Germany more than 40 percent of all saloons in this market segment have an \"E\"in their model plate, and in many western European countries this Mercedes model series is the number one in the luxury class.Since 1947, when the Model 170 V was introduced as the direct ancestor to the E-Class, Mercedes-Benz has produced more than ten million saloons belonging to this series. This makes the E-Class easily the world’s most successful business saloon.", "The new E-Class will appear in the showrooms of the European Mercedes sales and service outlets and dealerships in March 2009."], "post_order": "#18", "replier_post_ID": []},

Depending on the vehicle equipment and configuration, the European vehicles can achieve WLTP ranges of up to 590 kilometres2. In the EQE SUV, the lithium-ion battery consists of ten modules. In certain cases the innovative battery management software, which was developed in-house, can be updated over-the-air (OTA).", "The current generation of driving assistance systems includes numerous functions that support the driver. The general standard equipment of the EQE SUV includes ATTENTION ASSIST, Active Brake Assist, Active Lane Keeping Assist, Parking Package with reversing camera and Speed Limit Assist. The status and activity of the systems are shown in a full-screen view in the assistance display in the driver's display. Further options are available in the Assistance Package and also the Driving Assistance Plus Package.", "The chassis of the new EQE SUV comprises a four-link suspension at the front and an independent multi-link suspension at the rear. Due to the comparatively short wheelbase of 3030 millimetres and the corresponding suspension tuning, it feels particularly agile and manoeuvrable even with the basic set-up. The AIRMATIC air suspension with ADS+ continuously adjustable damping is available as an optional extra. To increase ground clearance, the vehicle level can be raised by up to 30 millimetres3. In addition to the DYNAMIC SELECT programs of ECO, COMFORT, SPORT and INDIVIDUAL, the EQE SUV models with 4MATIC also boast the OFFROAD program for off-road driving. A rear axle steering system with a maximum steering angle of 10 degrees is available as an option.", "The EQE SUV offers the possibility of activating additional vehicle functions via over-the-air technology (OTA) in a number of functional areas. This means that after purchase and having chosen the original new car configuration, some of the EQE SUV's equipment can be individually customised. The OTA functions are available in the Mercedes me Store, and the range will be successively expanded.", "With adaptive software, the MBUX display and operating system makes personalised suggestions for numerous infotainment, comfort and vehicle functions. A highlight of the interior is the optional MBUX Hyperscreen. With the zero-layer design, the user does not have to scroll through submenus or give voice commands. Situational and contextual applications are offered at the top level in the field of view. With the MBUX Hyperscreen (optional extra), three displays merge almost seamlessly into one another to create a screen band over 141 centimetres wide. The front passenger in the EQE SUV has the option of a 12.3-inch OLED display with its own user interface. The system uses an intelligent, camera-based blocking logic that recognises if the driver is looking toward the front passenger display. If this is the case, the system automatically dims the dynamic content for security reasons (see separate chapter).", "When it comes to Navigation with Electric Intelligence, the name says it all. For on the basis of numerous factors it plans the fastest and most convenient route including charging stops. It also reacts dynamically to traffic jams or a change in driving style, for example. Navigation with Electric Intelligence is clever; it calculates the estimated charging costs per charging stop. Furthermore, the customer can edit the planned routes individually. They can edit the planned routes individually by adding in preferred charging stations along the route or excluding proposed charging stations.", "The EQE SUV features a sophisticated thermal architecture with a heat pump as standard. This makes the system work very efficiently: the waste heat from the electric drive (inverter and electric motor) and also the high-voltage battery can be used to heat the interior. This reduces drastically the draw on battery power for the heating system, thus increasing the range. Another pleasant and efficient function is pre-entry climate control. The THERMATIC automatic climate control system with two climate zones is fitted as standard, while the THERMOTRONIC with four zones is available as an option.", "\"Serene Breeze\" is the name of the new, fourth soundscape that makes its debut in the EQE SUV. It offers a relaxed and natural sound. With the holistic sound staging, the paradigm shift from combustion engine to electric car becomes audible for the occupants in the Mercedes-EQ models. A variety of soundscapes allows for an individual acoustic set-up. An optional interior driving sound is available. This adjusts adaptively to the driving style.", "Since June 2022, Mercedes me Charge4 has been offering three new charging tariffs in Europe that are tailored to individual driving performance. Mercedes me Charge S for occasional chargers, Mercedes me Charge M for normal chargers and Mercedes me Charge L for frequent chargers. With the introduction of the new, transparent tariff system, customers have access in part to fixed prices that apply regardless of the operator. With the Plug & Charge function, the EQE SUV can also be conveniently charged.", "DIGITAL LIGHT headlamp technology (special equipment) makes innovative functions possible, such as the projection of auxiliary markings or warning symbols onto the road. Another equipment highlight is ENERGIZING AIR CONTROL Plus. A HEPA (High Efficiency Particulate Air) filter cleans the incoming outside air at its very high filtration level. ENERGIZING COMFORT links together various comfort systems in the vehicle. The individual ENERGIZING COMFORT programmes enable a special feel-good programme depending on the mood or needs of the customer. This enhances physical comfort and performance while driving and during a break. The Dolby Atmos sound formatÒ takes the audio experience in the EQE SUV to a new level.", "The proportions of the EQE SUV combine function and aesthetics with the sporty character of the SUV. The new model, with its unmistakable purpose design, marks a turning point in its class. The overhangs and the front-end assembly have been kept compact. The wheels in sizes from 19 to 22 inches are positioned flush with the outer edge of the body and lend a commanding stance.", "The EQE SUV shares some aerodynamic measures with its model brothers. The underbody with its numerous aerodynamic details plays a central role in a very good Cd value from 0.255, which was achieved despite the large load volume and short rear overhang. But the dimensional concept with the flat windscreen, sweeping roof line and indents were also important factors.", "The EQE SUV is based on the large electric platform from Mercedes‑EQ. On top of this it boasts an interior that has been consistently digitalised. The optionally available MBUX Hyperscreen implements this vision to impressive effect. The standard Electric Art interior does not make use of any leather at all.", "The principles of Integral Safety apply regardless of the type of drive system. Like all other Mercedes‑Benz models, the EQS SUV therefore has a rigid passenger compartment, special deformation zones and state-of-the-art restraint systems. The European version of the EQE SUV can detect whether the rear seats are actually occupied. If a passenger in the rear is not wearing a seat belt, the driver receives a specific warning. The so-called occupant presence reminder can indicate children who may have been overlooked in the rear of the vehicle. In vehicles for Europe, Australia, New Zealand, USA and Canada, this system is on board as standard.", "Production of the EQE SUV will start at the Mercedes‑Benz plant in Tuscaloosa, Alabama (USA) in December. The battery factory in nearby Bibb County supplies the batteries for this model as well as for the EQS SUV. Since this year, all of Mercedes‑Benz's own passenger car and van plants worldwide have achieved CO₂-neutral production as part of their eco-balance - including the two Mercedes‑Benz plants in Alabama."], "post_order": "#1", "replier_post_ID": []},

The brand will offer a versatile mix of configurations and options suitable to each customer’s unique requirements to optimize day-to-day operations and productivity. The class 4 and 5 medium-duty battery-electric vehicles, ranging from 15,995 up to 17,995 lbs in gross vehicle weight (GVW), are able to run from 110 -160 miles for L size variant with 3 battery packs) and 75 -110 miles (for M size variant with 2 battery packs) on a single charge*. These trucks are ideally suited to a variety of applications such as dry vans, flatbeds, landscape dumps, and reefers.

{"section_name": "Mercedes-Benz", "thread_title": "Modern classics: the S-Class Saloons of the Mercedes-Benz 140 series (1991 to 1998)", "post_ID": "post-464225", "post_date": "May 28, 2010", "post_username": "MBFanToDeath", "post_text": ["The 140 series S-Class Saloons gave a clear  message when they were  introduced in 1991: their size and design lent  them an imposing  appearance, combined with highest comfort and lavish  interior  spaciousness. Certainly these attributes are appropriate to a   Mercedes-Benz S-Class. And yet this model series was anything but   undisputed when it came out: critics complained it had turned out too   big, which brought disadvantages in everyday use, and on top of that was   out of step with the times. Such opinions were voiced mainly in  Europe.  In the USA or in Asia, for example, many customers took exactly  the  opposite view. For them, the 140 series was an S-Class in exactly  the  right format – precisely because of its impressive appearance,  which to  them was simply befitting of a vehicle in which the world’s  successful,  wealthy and political leaders could either drive themselves  or be  driven. This divergence of opinions was to accompany the saloons  of the  140 model series from that point on, and the successor series  launched  in 1998, the 220, turned out rather more discreet.  Nevertheless, the 140  series received a great deal of praise from all  sides. In 1991, for  example, the trade magazine Auto, Motor und Sport,   Germany, went as far as to write: “It would not be wrong here to   describe this as the world’s finest car – any less would be to do   Mercedes an injustice.”", "The world’s finest car – that is quite a claim.  But it is one  Mercedes-Benz and its predecessor brands have been living  up to since  the beginnings of the automobile. For the 140 series the  engineers and  designers addressed the task with the greatest dedication.  Leaving  aside the sheer dimensions of the body, one has to give great  credit to  the stylists under the supervision of chief designer Bruno  Sacco: what  they drafted was a luxury-class saloon with clear lines that   unmistakably established its connection with brand history, yet at the   same time delivered a statement for the 1990s and were almost timeless   in character. Almost twenty years on, a 140 series S-Class is still an   extremely handsome car.", "The high standard applied to the vehicle was  reflected in all  details. For instance, the interior, so lavishly  appointed,  simultaneously demonstrated the restraint desired by the  majority of  S-Class customers. Spaciousness and features made the time  spent in a  140 series S-Class an absolute enjoyment. That was also true  of the  driver’s seating position: perfectly equipped, it made even  extremely  long journeys exceedingly pleasurable.", "The suspension also played a part in this. The  engineers used all  their resourcefulness and skill to design it: not  only was travel in  the saloon extremely safe on any road surface, it was  also extremely  comfortably. In addition to excellent springing, the  body was decoupled  from audible and otherwise perceptible vibrations.  And although the  140 series S-Class was a big car, customers and motor  journalists all  over the world nevertheless praised it for its road  manners – it was  fleet-footed and able to negotiate even winding country  roads  impeccably at speed.", "Typical of the great effort invested by  Mercedes-Benz in this  vehicle, for example, was the double insulated  glazing, which benefited  safety and comfort in several ways: avoidance  of fogging  (condensation) and icing, enhanced thermal insulation,  enhanced  insulation against external sources of noise, better flow of  air around  the vehicle and prevention of wind noises caused by window  seals.  Never before had car windows been so meticulously designed.", "The high safety standard already attained in the  previous series was  clearly raised further by numerous measures. For  example, the body  structure of the 140 series afforded still more  protection in all types  of accidents. A number of details – solutions  designed to take the  sharpness out of potential points of contact –  served the protection of  other road users as well. The braking system  was state-of-the-art,  delivering optimum deceleration values. From 1995  onwards the  Electronic Stability Program ESP® was additionally  available, initially  for the eight-cylinder S-Class model and later for  all models with  automatic transmission. In the S 600 it was standard  equipment. After  December 1996 all models additionally featured the  Brake Assist BAS,  which optimally increased braking power under  emergency braking and  shortened the stopping distance.", "As was customary in the S-Class, six- and  eight-cylinder engines  were available to power the car – from 1991 on  there was even a  twelve-cylinder power plant. This unit epitomised the  art of engine  making, but the other units too enabled a mobility ideally  suited to  the Mercedes-Benz S-Class. All were fitted as standard with  an emission  control system featuring a closed-loop catalytic converter,  and  consequently satisfied comprehensive environmental standards.", "At the same time these engines were symbols of  the longevity of the  140 series – they, and, of course, the entire  vehicle, were designed  for very high mileages and thus for years and  years of use. That made  the 140 series S-Class well suited for use as a  modern classic: anyone  who buys one today, acquires a vehicle built to  meet the highest  requirements. In that sense it is part of the  remarkable tradition of  the luxury-class saloons of the Mercedes-Benz  brand, which together  with its predecessor brands goes back to the  beginnings of the  automobile.", "Mercedes-Benz’s excellent spare parts supply has  helped maintain a  modern classic: almost every part can be procured  through a  Mercedes-Benz dealer and the company’s own ordering system;  delivery is  usually made overnight. Some authorised service shops have  even been  designated Classic Partners, possessing outstanding competence  in  handling older vehicles. And particularly where young classics are   concerned, all Mercedes-Benz company-owned sales and service outlets and   partners boast the same high levels of expertise as ever. Not for   nothing does the slogan “Service for a lifetime” apply to all vehicles   of the brand.", "45 photos", "© 2010 The World Of Mercedes-Benz /////AMG. All rights reserved.", "© 2010 Daimler AG.

The BMW engine was basically meant as an answer to the Mercedes V12, it was the 5.0ltr V12 with additional 4 cylinders added that produced 6651cm3, power of 414PS (304kW) and 625nm of torque, capable of 0-100km/h in approx. 6.0sec and a delimited top speed of 175mph (282km/h). The BMW engine was so large for its engine bay that the radiators had to be fitted in the boot, so the car effectively had no luggage capacity.", "The Mercedes V16 would be the same concept as that of BMW by adding 4 cylinders onto the M120 6.0ltr V12 to produce an engine with 8.0ltr capacity. This would have been used for a super W140 S-class badged 800SE/SEL. Mercedes only built 3 to 5 prototype engines compared to 15 been rumored to be built by BMW.

I feel like M-B is starting to design their cars to fill a role of the Fast & Furious crowd within the luxury segment, if that could even make sense. Short sighted designs and strategies which are looking to be less of a premium manufacturer and more like a mass-market one.", "Be a design leader again, and by that I don't mean scribble nonsensical lines to try and look ultra-fad which will generate quick attention then date quickly. I want to see a monolithic, powerful, confident and GERMAN looking Benz again. Strong lines, connecting dots, an unmistakable presence, a clean and concise surface that sends a strong message of strength, simple beauty, harmony, and timelessness, and of course prestige. M-B is designing cars to look broken up, therefore M-B's today look stubbier and shorter than their competing counterparts. Audi's and BMW's with one long graceful line look elegant and long. M-B is trying to be \"crazy different\" but it's not having an elegant and \"sprawled out\" effect we like to see from long cars.", "IMO be like Apple in the sense where if a product isn't working, cut it as quickly as possible, to not dilute and harm the brands ultimate cachet. Dilution is a dangerous thing for a high margin luxury brand when a lot of their models can't even be considered top-tier within their segments, not to mention when you have scars of future embarrassments like the R Class, the first A-Class, etc.", "As an E-Class owner, I've gotten in plenty of arguments with 5-Series owners who say that the E-Class does NOTHING better. These days, although I still love my car, it's hard to find objective areas to prove otherwise.", "Areas where I'd like to see improved: INTERIOR MATERIAL QUALITY. Aside from the S-Class/CL/and new SL, I think M-B models interiors aren't so refined and detailed as they used to be. Cold plastics, austere feelings, general \"cheap\" materials here and there. Though, they do feel durable as all hell, they just don't feel \"warm\".", "I think M-B needs to figure out what they want to be in terms of driving style and go hard with it. They used to be the NO NONSENSE luxury driver. Now, they're trying to get a little \"BMW handling\" on us (BMW is going the other way, ironically, generating the same complaints but on the opposite end). I find my E-Class to be a confused ride. Soft on corners and smooth roads (so it floats), then it gets hard and extremely harsh over bumps. It does the wrong things at the wrong times. It should float and be soft over harsh roads, and get stiff and tight through turns, right now it does the opposite.", "I think the engines are fine, personally. But the 7G Tronic transmission is a joke. My 2011 E now has the same \"hiccup\" that my W211 did, which had to go to the shop about 5 times before they finally changed the valve body. When it works well, it works well, but there are lots of inherent bugs. It could also be A LOT snappier on shifting, without sacrificing the smoothness.", "The screen sizes don't bug me, but they could get bigger.", "Fix the suspension creak/squeak/groans. Every M-B I've had has this characteristic and \"old man car\" sounding sound. Even my 2 brand new E's. I'm skinny as heck yet the car creaks/squeaks when I get in or out of it. Embarrassing.", "TAKE THE HORN OFF OF THE ALARM! THIS STUPID COST CUTTING MEASURE MAKES OUR CARS SOUND LIKE CHEAP CHEVY RENTALS, WE SHOULDN'T GET SUCH A CRUDE GREETING WHEN WE SPEND PREMIUM DOLLARS.", "Fortunately, for M-B, they have over 100 years of prestige to allow them tons of apologists who will look past current shortcomings, or even convince themselves that M-B is releasing their best products ever. I was one of these people, but I couldn't hold onto the lie.", "Finally, I feel like participating in BMW message boards, and Porsche message boards is far more fun and enlightening. BMW enthusiasts seem to be far more product-driven, far more enthusiastic, they're even far more demanding and far more criticizing. I find M-B boards can be a bit clinical, i.e people just want the Star Car and aren't too crazy passionate about it to adore it endlessly or criticize it too much, just kind of chillaxed as compared to BMW and Porsche fans. That can be seen as a good or bad, but from my experiences, considering I'm obviously one of those crazy anal fans, I'd like to see M-B make products that attract the \"Intellectual Enthusiast\", rather than the \"I just want a Benz\" crowd. On the M-B boards, 90% of the Threads are about \"rims\" or lowering or changing out for a cheesy Star grille or something. On the BMW Boards, you have real deal, introspective enthusiast talks, some of it goes far more fanboy-ish than anything I've seen, but the passion in the core product is there."], "post_order": "#9", "replier_post_ID": []},

While MB is introducing separate BEV production lines within current production facilities, while VAG is not only introducing separate BEV production lines but also planing special BEV-only plants.", "So, the biggest difference is in the production.", "From this POV BMW will be able to utilize their production capacities better, and in a more flexible way, reacting faster to the demand (assuming they will have enough batteries available). While MB & VAG are under threat of decreased production on some of their lines or even plants - causing disruption and even possible profit plunder.", "Also - due to shared production on the same lines for every vehicle's drive type - BMW developed a highly modular e-engine & battery packs; modular new automatic gearboxes for MHVs and PHEVs etc. Such high level of modularity  will provide BMW with much needed flexibility when reacting to demand, and achieving better profit margins.

And another worthy achievement: the upcoming BMW's 5th generation of e-motors will be completely free of rare earths!", "So, we are still about 2 years or so off from the real BEV deal coming from German carmakers.

Sure some will be faster to the market than others. But sometimes being slower will result in better, more hi-tech solutions. Everybody is going BEV. That's a fact.

As a result, the base model of the E‑Class features a central star at the front for the first time. The new front end with increased chrome content plays a role in the fresh appearance: The grille of the Avantgarde Line was redesigned with two chrome louvres and vertical high-gloss black struts. Chrome and high-gloss black trim elements in the front bumper underscore the sporty and elegant appearance. The likewise available Exclusive Line lives up to its name: The special grille, the upright star on the bonnet and the large chrome elements in the front bumper emphasise this positioning.", "The AMG Line with a new bumper in the style of the AMG Performance models looks even sportier. In addition, Avantgarde, AMG Line and All-Terrain feature a bonnet with power domes. The E-Class features all-LED headlamps as standard. MULTIBEAM LED headlamps including ULTRA RANGE high beam are available as an option.", "The designers also updated the Saloon's rear end with a new bumper, split tail lamps and a new boot lid. The inner design of the tail lamps was revised for all models.", "The All-Terrain is visually more similar to the SUV models. In addition, signature All-Terrain components such as the radiator grille or the stylised skid plate now sport a mirror chrome finish rather than the previous silver shadow hue.", "The three new paint colours available for the E-Class as part of the model refresh go by the names high-tech silver, graphite grey metallic and mojave silver. The wheel line-up has also been expanded and now includes aero wheels, which also contribute to saving fuel and thus to sustainability.", "New appointment colours and materials upgrade the interior. These include the new colour combinations magma grey/neva grey (Avantgarde), black/nut brown (Exclusive) and magma grey/macchiato beige (Exclusive), and trim in open-pore silver ash wood, burr walnut fondant, brushed aluminium and aluminium with a carbon grain.", "The seats combine the hallmark Mercedes-Benz long-distance suitability with avant-garde design. The adaptive driver's seat adjustment is particularly convenient: When the height of the body is entered on the media display or via Mercedes me, the seat automatically moves into a usually fitting position, which only needs to be fine-tuned by the driver.", "The design of the front seats accentuates the sporty aura of the interior. They offer strong lateral support without compromising on comfort. The seat contour follows the pronounced side bolsters and, depending on the specification, the centre section has sporty transverse or modern longitudinal seams. The colours of the centre sections of the seat backrest and cushion are matched to the overall sculpture of the seats. Numerous material combinations ranging from fabric to ARTICO man-made leather to embossed leather to nappa leather with diamond quilting are possible.", "The new E-Class has the latest generation of Mercedes-Benz driving assistance systems providing cooperative support to drivers. This results in an especially high level of active safety: Saloon and Estate are able to react if the driver doesn't. The hands-off recognition now works on a capacitive basis. This enhances user-friendliness when driving in semi-automated mode. Because to inform the assistance systems that the driver still has control of the E-Class, it is sufficient for the driver to hold the steering wheell. A steering moment – that is to say a slight steering movement – was previously required as feedback. The new steering wheel (see next chapter for details) features a pad with the appropriate sensors in the rim. These register whether the driver is holding the wheel. If the system detects that the driver does not have their hands on the steering wheel for a certain time, a warning cascade is started, which finally activates Emergency Brake Assist if the driver continues to be inactive.", "As standard, the E-Class comes with", ", which in many situations is able to use autonomous braking to prevent a collision or mitigate its severity. The system is also able to brake for stationary vehicles and crossing pedestrians at typical city speeds and even to prevent collisions, depending on the situation. As part of the Driving Assistance Package, this is now also possible when turning off across the oncoming lane.", "Some Intelligent Drive functions can optionally be added to the Driving Assistance Package. They include", ", which uses map data and information from Traffic Sign Assist to respond to changes in the speed limit. Route-based speed adjustment ahead of bends, roundabouts, toll stations, T-junctions as well prior to turning off/exiting motorways/expressways is also included in the scope of delivery. When the driver switches on", "with route-based speed adjustment, the E-Class is now even able to respond to data from LiveTraffic Information. Ideally, this happens even before the driver or the radar and camera sensors are able to detect a traffic obstruction. When a tailback is detected, the speed is reduced to approx. 100 km/h as a precaution unless the driver deliberately decides otherwise.", "When driving in a tailback on the motorway,", "is largely able to perform the tasks of keeping in lane and maintaining the safety distance with a high level of availability at speeds up to around 60 km/h. The vehicle can restart automatically up to one minute after coming to a stop. On multi-lane roads,", "is able to support the driver with the", ", which causes the vehicle to stay off-centre in the lane. On motorways, at speeds under 60 km/h, the vehicle refers to detected lane markings and applies swarm intelligence to take its bearings from vehicles in the surrounding area. If none are detected, the E-Class takes its bearings from the vehicle ahead as before.", "with exit warning offers enhanced protection when getting out of the car. It is able to respond to vehicles in the blind spot as well as in the critical area with an active brake intervention. When the vehicle is stopped, the system can now also warn the passengers visually in the exterior mirror before they get out if a vehicle, even a bicycle, is driving past in the critical area. If the driver tries to use the door handle at this moment, an additional audible warning will sound and the ambient door lighting will start to flash red. It detects passing road users moving at a speed of more than 7 km/h. The function is also available when the vehicle is stationary and up to three minutes after the ignition has been switched off.", "and 360° camera makes it possible to enter and leave parking spaces automatically. The system facilitates the search for and selection of a parking space as well as entering and leaving (if the vehicle was parked automatically) parallel and end-on parking spaces or garages. For the first time, the new E-Class is able to recognise and use parking spaces which are only marked as areas on larger sites, for example. The 360° camera transmits an even more realistic image to the media display, which includes an expanded side view. When leaving a parking space, the system is able to warn of traffic crossing behind the vehicle and can apply the brakes in case of doubt.", "The E-Class is fitted with an entirely new steering wheel as part of the model update. It is available in three versions: as an all-leather steering wheel, in a wood-leather combination and in a supersport version. The control surfaces sport a high-gloss black finish, while the trim elements and surrounds have a silver shadow finish. The instrument cluster and the media display are controlled by swiping along the Touch Control buttons. The operating principle of the Touch Control buttons changes from optical to capacitive. A mechanical system was no longer needed, and the touch surfaces also are less susceptible to fingerprints. Whether the driver has control of the steering wheel is now determined by means of capacitive detection (see chapter on the driving assistance systems).", "The new E-Class is equipped with the latest generation of the MBUX multimedia system (Mercedes-Benz User Experience). As standard, it includes two large 10.25 inch/26 cm screens, which for a widescreen look are arranged side by side. Two 12.3 inch/31.2 cm screens are optionally available. The information in the instrument cluster and on the media display is easily legible on the large, high-resolution screens. An emotive presentation with brilliant graphics underlines the comprehensibility of the intuitive control structure.", "Depending on mood or to match the particular interior, the user has a choice of four different styles:", "Other strengths include touchscreen control of the media display as standard and the use of augmented reality technology for the navigation display when the navigation function is active: A video image of the surroundings is enhanced with helpful navigation information: arrows or house numbers are automatically superimposed directly onto the image in the media display, for example. The system also assists the driver at traffic lights: If the E-Class is the first car at the lights, the current traffic light situation is superimposed. In this way, this new function is a particular help when there is an unfavourable line of sight to the traffic lights.", "The optional MBUX Interior Assistant allows intuitive, natural operation of various comfort and MBUX functions also by movement recognition. When a hand approaches the touchscreen or the touchpad on the centre console, the media display changes, and individual elements are highlighted, for example.", "ENERGIZING seat kinetics is another new feature in the E-Class. It supports beneficial changes in seated posture by means of minute movements of the seat cushion and backrest when on a journey.", "ENERGIZING comfort control networks various comfort systems in the vehicle, and uses musical and lighting moods plus a number of massage modes for a wide range of feel-good programmes. The \"PowerNap\" programme is available in the plug-in hybrids, which is useful when taking a break from driving at a rest area or when charging the battery en route, for example. The programme has three phases – falling asleep, sleeping, waking – and can enhance the performance of the driver and provide new energy.", "The ENERGIZING COACH is based on an intelligent algorithm, and recommends one of the programmes suited to the individual and situation. If a Garmin® wearable is integrated, personal values such as stress level or quality of sleep optimise the accuracy of the recommendation. The aim is for passengers to feel well and relaxed even during demanding or monotonous journeys.", "URBAN GUARD: Intelligent interlinking of hardware and digital solutions for protection against crime", "Under the name URBAN GUARD, Mercedes-Benz is introducing a new comprehensive category of products and options for all model series. It bundles existing and future products for the protection of the vehicle against vandalism and crime. With URBAN GUARD – an intelligent interlinking of hardware and digital solutions – Mercedes-Benz satisfies the worldwide rise in customer demand for security and property protection.", "Two option packages, URBAN GUARD Vehicle Protection and URBAN GUARD Vehicle Protection Plus, are planned from mid-2020. Some URBAN GUARD products will also be available from the Mercedes me online store for subsequent activation.", "In conjunction with Mercedes me, the two packages URBAN GUARD Vehicle Protection and URBAN GUARD Vehicle Protection Plus enable all-round monitoring of the parked vehicle. URBAN GUARD comprises an anti-theft alarm system, tow-away protection with visual and audible warning in case of a detected change in position, an alarm siren, interior monitoring (triggers in case of movements in the interior) as well as a pre-installation for theft and parking collision detection. In case of the latter, the vehicle sensors register when the parked and locked vehicle is bumped or towed – or when someone attempts to break into the vehicle. If the service is active, the driver is informed via the Mercedes me app. By means of push notification, he finds out, for example, how severe and in which area of the vehicle the parking damage is. As soon as the vehicle is restarted, this information also is shown once on the media display.", "In addition, URBAN GUARD Vehicle Protection Plus is able to pinpoint the location of stolen vehicles. In case of theft, this also makes it possible to recover the vehicle even if the thief has deactivated the vehicle tracking function, for example. This takes place in cooperation with police.", "The electrification of the powertrain takes another major step forward with the model update of the E-Class. Seven models are available as plug-in hybrids (diesel and petrol, Saloon and Estate, rear-wheel drive and all-wheel drive). The line-up of high-efficiency, low-emission and powerful petrol engines will cover a range from 115 to 270 kW, while the spectrum of diesel vehicles spans from 118 to 243 kW.", "For the first time, a four-cylinder petrol engine (M 254) with second-generation integrated starter-generator (ISG) producing up to 15 kW of additional output and 180 Nm more torque will complement the engine range. Models equipped with this engine will have a 48-volt on-board electrical system. Thanks to energy recovery and the ability to \"glide\" with the engine switched off, the petrol engine is highly efficient.", "In the M 254, Mercedes-Benz has for the first time combined all the innovations of the modular engine family of 4- and 6-cylinder petrol and diesel units in a single engine. They include the NANOSLIDE® cylinder coating, the CONICSHAPE® cylinder honing (trumpet honing) and the emission control system positioned directly at the engine. A completely new feature is the segment charger with flow connection, an advancement of the twin-scroll technology for even more instantaneous response of the forced induction system. When needed, an electric additional compressor quickly builds up the charge pressure – especially at low combustion engine speeds – and thereby contributes to a highly dynamic throttle response.", "The in-line six-cylinder petrol engine (M 256), available for the first time in the E-Class, is also fitted with an ISG. The engine line-up is rounded off by the six-cylinder diesel (OM 656). This engine and the OM 654 four-cylinder version feature an expanded emission control system.", "Its components include", "The 9G-TRONIC transmission has also been advanced for the adaptation of the second-generation ISG and in a first step is used with the four-cylinder engine. The electric motor, the power electronics and the transmission cooler have now moved into or to the transmission. Previously required cables are eliminated, which offers advantages with regard to installation space and weight. This makes it easy to combine the transmission with the different combustion engines. In addition, the efficiency of the transmission was increased. Amongst other things, the optimised interplay with the electric auxiliary oil pump reduces the delivery rate of the mechanical pump by 30 percent. Furthermore, it uses a new generation of the fully integrated transmission control with multi-core processor and new construction and joining technology. In addition to the increased computing power, the number of electric interfaces has been drastically reduced, and the weight of the transmission control has been cut by 30 percent.", "Already in the early 20th century, vehicles positioned below the top-of-the-range and luxury classes, yet above the compact class, were an essential part of the model portfolio of Mercedes-Benz and the brands that came before. The first Mercedes models, which came to market in 1901 and established the concept of modern automotive construction, were already available in different versions and targeted different customers – including those who would choose a vehicle of the upper mid-range segment today.", "With over 14 million units delivered since 1946, the E-Class is the best-selling model series in the history of Mercedes-Benz. It is perceived by many as the \"heart of the brand\". Customers of the E-Class are among the most loyal fans of the Mercedes star: Eight out of ten customers of the E-Class Saloon remain loyal to Mercedes-Benz when buying the next vehicle.", "When production started up again after the Second World War, the first car to go into production was the 170 V model, originally introduced in 1936, initially as a vehicle for rescue services, police, commerce and trades. It was soon followed by a saloon version as the first post-war Mercedes-Benz passenger car in 1947.", "The 180 model (W 120) of 1953 with unibody and \"Ponton\" shape set new technical as well as formal trends. It was followed in 1961 by the four-cylinder versions of the \"Fintail\" model series (W 110) – the first model with safety body and crumple zones. The next major step came seven years later in the form of the \"Stroke Eight\" (model series W 115/114). At the same time, with the arrival of the first coupé model, this marked a widening of the scope of available body variants. Its success was surpassed yet again by the successor model series 123 starting in 1976. It was also produced in an estate version – with which Mercedes-Benz set standards for the estate car as a family-friendly lifestyle and recreational vehicle. The 124 series of the years 1984 to 1995, which was also available as a four-seater cabriolet, was first given the name E-Class in mid-1993.", "The \"four headlamps\" face and its innovative technology were the characteristic features of the 210 model series launched in 1995. The E-Class of model series 211 was launched in early 2002. In 2009 it was followed by the 212 series (Saloon and Estate) and the 207 series (Cabriolet and Coupé), and from 2010 the E-Class Saloon also became available as the V 212 long version produced in and for China. In 2016, Mercedes-Benz launched the E-Class of model series 213. Starting in 2017, the Estate was also available as an All-Terrain version for the first time.", "More than 351,000 E-Class Saloon and Estate vehicles were delivered to customers in the third full year the new generation was on the market. The significance of China as the most important market for the saloons from", "Mercedes-Benz is clearly evident in the E-Class: The long-wheelbase version of the E-Class Saloon set a new record and saw double-digit growth in sales there. One out of every two E-Class Saloons sold worldwide in 2019 was delivered as a long-wheelbase version in China. In South Korea, the E-Class Saloon recorded the highest one-year sales to date.", "The E-Class Saloon and Estate are produced in the Mercedes-Benz Sindelfingen Plant and come off the same line as the Mercedes-Benz CLS and the Mercedes-AMG GT 4-door Coupé in a flexible production system. The production uses modern digital technologies – from smartphones for locating vehicles on the line and additive manufacturing methods for producing equipment to digital shop floor management, which involves various key indicators being managed in one system. The production also uses the Ubisense system. This system locates the fastening tools an employee requires in the assembly process and provides the employee with the necessary information about a specific vehicle. In this way, only the tools actually required for working on the vehicle are activated. The employee receives optimal support in the assembly process.", "The Sindelfingen plant is the centre of competence for passenger cars of the upper and luxury segment as well as the lead plant for the S- and E-Class. The location employs more than 35,000 people. In addition to the aforementioned models, Mercedes-Benz produces the S-Class Saloon, Coupé and Cabriolet, Mercedes-Maybach S-Class as well as the Mercedes-AMG GT family there. Going forward, this will also be the location for the production of electric vehicles of the new EQ product and technology brand. Starting in 2022, the Mercedes-Benz Sindelfingen Plant will be fully CO2-neutral. Furthermore, \"Factory 56\", one of the world's most cutting-edge automobile production facilities, is currently under construction at the location.", "\"Our revised E 53 4MATIC+ is extensively enhanced, both as a saloon and an estate. The visual update offers our customers real added value, which is impressively underscored by our hallmark AMG grille. With the electrified 3.0-litre engine we have retained the proven drivetrain. The extensively revised suspension now offers even more of a range between long-distance comfort and precise dynamism\", says Tobias Moers, Chairman of the Management Board of Mercedes-AMG GmbH.", "The further visual characteristics of the Saloon and the Estate include the bonnet with two distinctive powerdomes, the large outer air inlets with two cross louvres and the new front splitter in silver chrome. The flics in high-gloss black improve the aerodynamics where it matters. The key identifier on the tail end are the round twin tailpipe trim elements, which are available in high-gloss chrome or high-gloss black (as part of the Night Package). The Saloon is given new, two-piece all-LED tail lights, the Estate adopts their new interior design.", "The dynamic appearance is rounded off by restyled 19-inch light-alloy wheels in an aerodynamically optimised 5-twin-spoke design. 20-inch light-alloy wheels in a 5-twin-spoke design are optionally available, also aerodynamically optimised and with a wider rim edge, painted in a choice of matt black or high-gloss titanium grey.", "With the optional AMG Night Package the new E 53 models can take on an even sportier appearance. The front splitter, mirror caps, disc frame, longitudinal member inserts, trim strip in the rear apron and tailpipe trim elements are styled in high-gloss black here. In conjunction with the Night Package, the darkened AMG radiator grille is available as a further optional extra. It adds a final individual touch to the front design.", "The interior of the new models welcomes the occupants with AMG-specific appointments, luxurious materials and the latest-generation MBUX infotainment system. The synthesis of exclusivity and sportiness is embodied by the sports seats in black ARTICO man-made leather/DINAMICA microfibre with an AMG design, red contrasting topstitching and an AMG badge. As an option, AMG Performance Seat Packages can be ordered for all the available upholsteries, both in ARTICO man-made leather/DINAMICA microfibre and in nappa leather. There are also red seat belts and various trim elements.", "Visually the two displays for the instrument cluster and multimedia displays blend beneath a shared glass cover to form the Widescreen Cockpit. The customer can choose between the three AMG display styles \"Modern Classic\", \"Sport\" and \"Supersport\" for the instrument cluster. The \"Supersport\" mode is particularly striking with a central, round rev counter and additional information presented in the form of bars to the left and right of the rev counter. Via the AMG menu, the driver can call up various special displays such as Engine Data, gear speed indicator, Warm-up, Set-up, G-Meter and RACETIMER. With individual AMG displays such as visualisation of the drive programs or telemetry data, the touchscreen multimedia display likewise underlines the dynamic configuration.", "AMG TRACK PACE, the virtual race engineer, is also optionally available for the E 53 models: The software is part of the MBUX infotainment system, and when negotiating a race circuit it continuously monitors more than 80 vehicle-specific sets of data (e.g. speed, acceleration). On top of this, lap and sector times are displayed, as well as the respective difference from a reference time. The MBUX Augmented Reality function also allows the ideal line of a stored race track to be displayed on the multimedia display or optional head-up display, allowing the driver to improve lap times with a virtual instructor on board.", "With a fresh design and seamlessly integrated buttons the new AMG Performance steering wheel creates an even closer link between human and machine. The three rounded twin spokes combine stability with lightness, and the steering wheel rim is a hallmark motorsport feature. The cover is selectable in leather, in DINAMICA microfibre or as a combination of leather and microfibre - on request with steering wheel heating. In the steering wheel rim there is also a capacitive sensor mat to recognise \"hands-on\". If the system detects that the driver does not have their hands on the steering wheel for a certain time, a warning cascade is started, which finally activates Emergency Brake Assist if the driver continues to be inactive.", "The capacitive switches which are seamlessly integrated into the surfaces of the horizontal twin spokes are new and sport a very elegant look. Haptic sensing aids in the area of the symbols make control easier. Via the left-hand sensor surface on the upper steering wheel spokes the instrument cluster is operated, the media display via the right-hand sensor surface. The lower spokes contain the controls for the cruise control/DISTRONIC (left) and telephone/hands-free system/volume control (right). The optional AMG steering wheel buttons for actuating the drive programs and further, individually definable functions include even more brilliant displays and are now both round.", "Via the metal shift paddles arranged on the left and right behind the steering wheel rim the AMG SPEEDSHIFT TCT 9G transmission can be operated manually. The restyled paddles are ergonomically adapted to the new AMG Performance steering wheel, slightly larger than previously and positioned further down.", "The 3.0-litre six-cylinder in-line engine of the E 53 models is characterised by top performance and intelligent electrification. The EQ Boost starter-alternator combines a starter motor and alternator in a powerful electric motor and is fitted between the engine and transmission. It is not only used as an electric alternator, but also performs hybrid functions. These include boost with 16 kW of output and 250 Nm of torque, recuperation, shifting of the load point, gliding mode and the virtually imperceptible restarting of the engine with the start/stop function. This innovation as well as the intelligent charging via an electric additional compressor and an exhaust gas turbocharger all have the same goal: to enhance the hallmark AMG performance and driving dynamics, while at the same time reducing fuel consumption and emissions. The starter-alternator provides support with its boost when moving off, plus the electric additional compressor builds up a high charge pressure without any delay, for a faster increase in torque for acceleration until the large exhaust gas turbocharger is deployed. As a result the 3.0-litre engine reacts extremely spontaneously, and provides a highly dynamic response without what is known as turbo lag. An additional bonus is the high level of refinement of the six-cylinder in-line engine.", "The AMG Driver's Package allows the electronically limited top speed in the new E 53 models to be increased to", "270 km/h (standard: 250 km/h). The high-performance brake system is naturally appropriate for the power and performance: the front axle features cross-drilled and vented discs of size 370 x 36 mm with four-piston fixed callipers and AMG lettering, the rear axle is fitted with vented discs of size 360 x 26 mm with single-piston floating callipers.", "The new 3.0-litre in-line engine is coupled with the AMG SPEEDSHIFT TCT 9G transmission, which impresses with extremely short shift times, fast response to shift paddle commands, a double-declutching function and multiple downshifts. Whether automatic or initiated by the driver using the steering wheel shift paddles, upshifts or downshifts are implemented instantly. Especially in the \"Sport+\" drive program and in manual mode, the transmission is very responsive. Dynamic acceleration and very short shift times are just as available as a fuel-efficient driving style, depending on the selected mode.", "With the five DYNAMIC SELECT drive programs \"Slippery\", \"Comfort\", \"Sport\", \"Sport+\" and \"Individual\", the characteristics of the new 53-series models can be influenced by the tap of a finger. The available range extends from efficient and comfortable to very sporty. The modes modify key parameters, such as the response of the engine, transmission, suspension and steering. Independently of the DYNAMIC SELECT drive programs, the driver has the option of switching directly to manual mode, in which gearshifts are executed exclusively using the shift paddles on the steering wheel. The suspension set-ups can also be selected specifically as needed.", "AMG DYNAMICS vehicle dynamics control is integrated into the AMG DYNAMIC SELECT drive programs. In the \"Basic\", \"Advanced\" and \"Pro\" levels, it influences the control strategies of the ESP® (Electronic Stability Program) or the all-wheel drive, for example. The intelligent pilot control anticipates the desired vehicle behaviour based on the driver's actions and the sensor data. The spectrum ranges from extremely stable to highly dynamic. Via the AMG steering wheel buttons the AMG DYNAMICS functions can also be individually selected.", "More agility, neutral cornering performance and greater traction come courtesy of the AMG RIDE CONTROL+ air suspension developed in Affalterbach. The multi-chamber air suspension with particularly sporty spring/damper set-up and continuously adjustable damping ADS+ (Adaptive Damping System) combines outstanding driving dynamics with high ride comfort. A harder spring rate, for example, when cornering and braking, effectively reduces body roll.", "The damping at each wheel is adjusted to suit the current driving situation and the condition of the road. This is done rapidly and precisely, using two separate valves for the rebound and compression forces in the dampers. The damping characteristics can also be preselected in three modes, \"Comfort\", \"Sport\" and \"Sport+\", allowing a significantly more noticeable differentiation between excellent long-distance comfort and sporty driving dynamics.", "The fully variable AMG Performance 4MATIC+ all-wheel drive combines optimal traction for dynamic driving fun with a high level of driving safety in all conditions: in the dry, in the wet or in snow. The transition from rear-wheel to all-wheel drive and vice versa is seamless, because the intelligent control is integrated into the overall vehicle system architecture.", "For an even more emotively appealing driving experience the optional AMG Dynamic Plus Package pools technical and visual equipment details previously reserved for the eight-cylinder models. The highlights include the RACE drive program with Drift Mode. The AMG Performance steering wheel in DINAMICA microfibre or in leather has steering wheel buttons for fast control of the drive programs and further settings for the driving dynamics. Brake callipers painted in red visually underscore the sporty character."], "post_order": "#5", "replier_post_ID": []},

So, let’s take a closer look at the tenth generation E-Class as shown in the soon-to-be official press shots.", "The car’s design bears a strong resemblance to the lines shown by the C-Class and the S-Class. Mercedes-Benz naturally adapted the design of this model to the one shown by its other sedan siblings and left the E-Class without its previous identity.", "The car now looks just like you’d expect of a model fitted in between the C-Class and the S-Class. Mercedes’ German counterparts apply the same “Matryoshka” effect on their ranges, so why shouldn’t the Stuttgart-born brand do it as well?", "The new E-Class is 43 mm longer than its predecessor and has had its wheelbase increased by 65 mm. The difference between the length and the wheelbase is made by shorter front and back overhangs.", "However, the designers managed to make the hood rather long and still pulled off an elegant look, just like most of its predecessors had. What’s left to be seen is if the new look will stand the test of time, but we’ll only know the answer to this in ten years or so.", "The 4,923 mm (193.8 in) body has a drag coefficient of only 0.23, and serious weight-saving measures have been applied to make the new E-Class as light as it can be. Thanks to the improved aerodynamic specs, the car will provide less noise at highway speeds and improved fuel economy.", "The guys at Mercedes-Benz didn’t settle for aerodynamic tweaks to lower the perceived decibels inside, so the new E-Class features better soundproofing and improved NVH (Noise, Vibration, Harshness) characteristics.", "At launch, the new E-Class will be available with several engine options. The entry in the MY 2017 E-Class range will be the E200, fitted with a four-cylinder gasoline engine. Its diesel equivalent will be the E220d, which features an all-new four-cylinder unit.", "According to Auto Presse, the only transmission available at launch will be the 9G-Tronic automatic.", "After the initial launch, other engine options will be available. Among them, Mercedes-Benz will offer a plug-in hybrid called the E350e, good for around 30 kilometers (18,6 miles) of 100% electric driving. The E350e is said to provide a hybrid drivetrain with 279 HP and 600 Nm (442 lb-ft) of torque on tap.

September 2017", "Stuttgart. As members of the large and successful S-Class family, the coupé and cabriolet will soon benefit from the same extensive innovations that have just been introduced on the saloon. These include new or functionally considerably extended driving assistance systems, the modern control and display concept with Widescreen Cockpit and new generation of steering wheels, integrated ENERGIZING comfort control and the latest infotainment generation. Exclusive to both of the two-door models and part of the standard equipment specification are innovative OLED tail lamps. The new V8 biturbo engine in the S 560 Coupé is even more dynamic (combined fuel consumption: 8.0 l/100 km; combined CO2emissions: 183 g/km) and S 560 Cabriolet (combined fuel consumption: 8.7 l/100 km; combined CO2emissions: 199 g/km).", "\"With their unmistakable, exclusive design and high-class materials with extremely high value appeal in the interior, the new S-Class Coupé and S-Class Cabriolet embody our interpretation of modern luxury. On top of that, both luxury four-seaters feature the latest cutting-edge technology from the S-Class,\" says Britta Seeger, Member of the Board of Management of Daimler AG with responsibility for Mercedes-Benz Cars Sales.", "The further-developed design exudes even greater sportiness while showing off the high technical expertise. S-Class Coupé and Cabriolet feature front aprons with chrome-plated front splitter and voluminous air inlets. The dynamic looks are enhanced by restyled side skirts and chrome-plated twin tailpipe trims with a V12 look.", "The AMG Line is also made more dynamic with new front and rear aprons. Especially striking at the front end are the large three-dimensional air inlets, which each include two chrome-plated fins.", "Innovative OLED tail lamps as standard", "Innovative OLED tail lamps are a new feature of the S-Class Coupé and S-Class Cabriolet. With this technology (organic light emitting diode), wafer-thin layers of organic materials are printed on a glass plate and made to illuminate. The total of 66 ultra-flat OLEDs act like floating elements inside the tail lamp; in addition, they emit a highly homogeneous light pattern in all directions and form a unique day and night design. Locking and unlocking the vehicle is additionally emphasised by an animated dynamic light sequence with subsequent dimming-up of the tail lights. Of course, the OLED tail lamps also employ the usual Mercedes-Benz multi-level technology with different levels of intensity for brake lamps and turn signal indicators depending on the driving condition and ambient brightness (day/night).", "Two new wheels allow further individualisation of the vehicle in conjunction with the AMG Line. These are 50.8 cm (20-inch) AMG 10-spoke wheels including AMG wheel arch flares painted in titanium grey with a high-sheen finish (optional for AMG Line) or painted in high-gloss black with a high-sheen finish (optional for AMG Line Plus).", "Luxury lounge with Widescreen Cockpit and new generation of steering wheels", "A fresh interior look is guaranteed by three new trim lines (high-gloss brown burr walnut wood, satin-finish grey ash wood and flowing lines designo magnolia wood) as well as three new upholstery lines (designo Exclusive nappa leather AMG Line Plus porcelain/tizian red, designo Exclusive nappa leather porcelain/tizian red and designo Exclusive nappa leather AMG Line Plus Bengal red/black).", "The interior of the new S-Class models is characterised by the two new high-resolution and brilliant displays, each with a screen diagonal of 12.3 inches.

The all-digital cockpit offers the three visually very different styles \"Classic\", \"Sporty\" and \"Progressive\". Depending on personal preference or matching the selected interior, the styles can be quickly changed from the instrument cluster and the central display. Alongside certain menu contents, such as trip data or consumption figures, the driver can now additionally view the navigation data or the ECO display in the instrument cluster. This helps the driver to make their driving style more efficient.", "Both models have Touch Control Buttons on the steering wheel. They respond to swiping motions like the screen of a smartphone. They enable the driver to control the functions of the instrument cluster and of the entire infotainment system without having to take their hands off the steering wheel. The operation of DISTRONIC and cruise control with controls directly on the steering wheel is another new feature.", "The infotainment system can also be operated via the touchpad with controller in the centre console and by LINGUATRONIC voice control. Voice control has for the first time been extended to include vehicle functions. Voice commands can now also be used to control the air conditioning and seat heating/ventilation, interior lighting (ambient lighting, reading lights, lighting in the rear), fragrancing/ionisation, seat massage function and Head-up Display. Depending on language version and vehicle equipment, up to 450 individual voice commands are now possible.", "The latest-generation COMAND Online offers fast 3D hard-disc navigation with topographical map display, photo-realistic 3D buildings and 3D map rotations.

It systematically uses the functions of the climate control system (including fragrancing) and the seats (heater, ventilation, massage), the panel heating as well as lighting and musical atmospheres, and enables a specific wellness set-up tailored to the mood and need of the customer. As a result, well-being and performance levels are enhanced.", "Depending on the equipment level, up to six programs are available:", "The programs all run for ten minutes. They are visualised on the head unit with colour graphics, and backed by suitable music. Five songs are already stored in the program. The key function in the \"Vitality\" program, for example, is fast music with many beats per minute. The S-Class repertoire therefore features \"Feelin' Good\" by Leon Riskin, for instance. If personal music selections are available, e.g. via the Media Interface, the system analyses them in the background and assigns them to a program based on the beats per minute (bpm). Individual functions of the programs can be deactivated.", "ENERGIZING comfort control also incorporates ambient lighting, which is harmoniously tailored to each of the individual screen designs.

The charging pad is integrated into the stowage compartment at the front of the centre console. In addition, Multifunction Telephony (optional feature) allows suitably designed mobile phones to be connected with the vehicle's exterior aerial.", "New driving assistance systems with extended functions", "The S-Class Coupé and Cabriolet are taking a further large step towards autonomous driving and are moving to the next level with new or functionally considerably extended Intelligent Drive driving assistance systems. Active Distance Control DISTRONIC and Active Steering Assist now provide even more comfortable support for the driver to keep a safe distance and steer. The speed is now adjusted automatically ahead of bends, junctions or roundabouts, for example (country-specific variations may occur in terms of the individual functions). For this purpose, for example, Active Distance Control DISTRONIC makes considerably greater use of map and navigation data than hitherto.", "Suspension with eyes now sees even better", "In 2014 in the S-Class Coupé, the optional MAGIC BODY CONTROL suspension with curve tilting function was a world first in a standard-production car. The body tilts to the inside of the turn by up to 2.65 degrees and thereby reduces the transverse forces perceived by the passengers. This innovative system recognises bends with the help of a stereo camera behind the windscreen, and a lateral acceleration sensor of the ROAD SURFACE SCAN suspension. In the new S-Class Coupé, this suspension control is further improved: the system's new stereo camera has a much better performance and works at speeds up to 180 km/h.", "The S-Class Cabriolet is fitted as standard with the full-support AIRMATIC semi-active air suspension featuring infinitely variable damping control.", "New V8 biturbo with cylinder shutoff, V6 with gliding function", "The new V8 biturbo in the S 560 Coupé and S 560 Cabriolet is one of the world's most economical V8 petrol engines and consumes up to eight percent less than its predecessor. To lower the fuel consumption, four cylinders of the new V8 are deactivated simultaneously under partial load with the help of the CAMTRONIC valve-lift adjustment system (Coupé only). This reduces the pumping losses while improving the overall efficiency of the remaining four cylinders by shifting the operating point towards higher loads. The turbochargers positioned in the V of the cylinder banks represent another special feature. The new V8 has an output of345 kW (469 hp) with a peak torque of 700 Nm.", "The Coupé with V6 petrol engine and a rated output of270 kW (367 hp) is now called the S 450 (combined fuel consumption: 8.9 l/100 km; combined CO2 emissions: 204 g/km). A new gliding function contributes to efficiency under real driving conditions. When the driving situation and charge level of the battery allow, the combustion engine is decoupled from the powertrain and runs at idle, so that the vehicle can coast freely.

Whether on or off the road and whatever the operating conditions, the off-road vehicle impresses with its performance, cutting-edge assistance systems, outstanding handling, and safety. At the same time, the new suspension, the DYNAMIC SELECT driving modes, the \"G-Mode\" and the three 100-percent differential locks enhance not only ride comfort but also agility - on any surface.", "\"The new G-Class is setting the bar higher still in all relevant areas - in terms of performance both on and off the road as well as with regard to comfort and telematics. Our 'longest-serving' model series is therefore ideally equipped to continue its success story. In short, the new 'G' is still a 'G', only better\", stresses Ola Källenius, Member of the Board of Daimler AG responsible for Group Research and Mercedes-Benz Cars Development.", "Working on the development of the new G-Class was extremely challenging for the team. \"Enhancing an icon such as the G-Class in technological terms was both a challenge and an opportunity at the same time. Each part and every bolt came under close scrutiny\", explains Dr Gunnar Güthenke, Head of the Off-Road Product Group at Mercedes-Benz. \"With the body, our main focus was on increasing the vehicle rigidity and the connections between the suspension and drivetrain with the ladder-type frame\".", "At the time of market launch in June 2018, the Mercedes-Benz G-Class will be available at an entry-level price of €107,040.50 (price in Germany, incl. VAT) and thus remains at the level of the preceding version. The specification includes a host of new features such as the LED headlamps, the driving assistance systems, the high-quality interior with leather seats, and the new suspension. For demanding customers, options such as the Exclusive Interior Plus with leather on the interior door panels provides even more exclusivity.", "The G-Class, the luxury off-road vehicle from Mercedes-Benz, has long been considered a design icon. Its external appearance has not changed significantly since 1979. Iconic elements continue to serve very specific purposes, now as then, and to give the G-Class its unique appearance. All these are still found in the new G-Class: the distinctive door handle and the characteristic closing sound, the robust exterior protective strip, the exposed spare wheel on the rear door and the prominent indicator lights. Extraordinary features like these in concert with the off-roader's angular lines define its special look.", "The enhanced design of the Mercedes-Benz G-Class follows the philosophy of Sensual Purity and at the same time remains true to the character of the original. As a result, the door hinges positioned on the outside and the surface-mounted bonnet are carried over to the new generation. With the latest update, the off-road icon - which has been continually enhanced technically over the decades but visually has hardly changed - is making the leap into a new era - both in terms of technology and form. The new G-Class is 53 mm longer and 121 mm wider and now has even greater presence, on the road as well as in terrain.", "More than ever, the new G-Class appears to be cast from a single piece. All surfaces have a more taut design and are have more tension, while the surface quality has been taken to an even higher level. This results in narrower, more precise gaps and more harmonious transitions. In addition, the wheel arches and bumpers form a more integral part of the body and thus look less like add-on features.", "While the exterior maintains the iconic classic look, the interior of the Mercedes-Benz G-Class has undergone a fundamental modern redesign which reinterprets the genes of the classic vehicle to reflect the exterior. With its off-road character and top-class luxury appointments, the G-Class has always combined two extremes into a harmonious symbiosis. Unmistakable at first glance and from the first touch, only high-quality materials are used. Every detail is finished by hand with the utmost care.", "Getting in the G-Class reveals that numerous design features from the exterior have been transposed into the interior. The shape of the round headlamps, for instance, which is reflected in the side air vents. Or the design of the iconic indicators, found again in the shape of the loudspeakers. Hallmarks of the G-Class include the grab handle in front of the front passenger and the chrome-highlighted switches for the three differential locks. Both have been meticulously optimised and retained as characteristic features.", "The very clearly arranged and completely redesigned instrument panel features timeless tube-look analogue round dials as standard. In other words, fans of classic round instruments will certainly not be disappointed in the new G-Class. As in the new E-Class and S-Class, an instrument cluster in the form of a large display showing virtual instruments in the driver's direct field of vision and a central display above the centre console is available as an option. In this case the two 12.3-inch displays blend visually into a Widescreen Cockpit beneath a shared glass cover. Drivers can choose between three different styles for the displays - \"Classic\", \"Sport\" and \"Progressive\" - and also select relevant information and views according to their individual needs.", "Thanks to haptic impulses and audible feedback from the on-board speakers, drivers can use the touchpad with controller in the centre console without taking their eyes off the road. The input options are rounded off by shortcut keys in front of the controller for frequently used operating tasks, and by the optional control panel for the driving assistance systems above the rotary light switch. The driver sits up close to the windscreen and enjoys good all-round visibility from behind the wheel.", "The revised dimensions of the now larger Mercedes-Benz G-Class benefit not only the driver and front passenger, but also the passengers in the second row. Key data at a glance:", "The rear seats can be folded down to 60, 40 or 100 percent. The seats in the G-Class are equipped as standard with numerous convenience functions and are ergonomically designed, thus providing enhanced seating comfort and lateral support. Features include the Memory function for the driver's seat, seat heating front and rear, as well as luxury head restraints in the front. This ride comfort can optionally be boosted still further with the Active Multicontour Seat Package. In addition to the special multicontour seats, this encompasses such features as various massage functions, climate-controlled seats, and fast seat heating. This variant also offers electrically adjustable lumbar supports for the driver and front passenger. The side sections of the seat cushions and backrests of the active multicontour seats include integrated air chambers that fill or empty continuously depending on the driving dynamics, thus providing better support for the seating positions of driver and front passenger and, for example, offering more lateral support during cornering. The front seats of the Active Multicontour Seat Package are recommended by experts from the German spinal health organisation \"Aktion Gesunder Rücken e.V.\".", "The primary goal of development was to redefine the quality of the handling both on and off the road. This goal has been achieved: The new G-Class performs even better off-road, while on the road it is significantly more agile, dynamic and comfortable than its predecessor. The G thus remains a true G - thanks to its standard ladder-type frame, the three 100-percent differential locks and LOW RANGE off-road gear reduction.", "The new suspension emerged from the collaboration between Mercedes-Benz G GmbH and Mercedes-AMG GmbH. The result is an independent suspension with double-wishbone front axle in combination with a rigid rear axle. As part of their work, the engineers had the task of fighting for every millimetre, because off-road capability not least also means maximum ground clearance. The raising of the axles makes a decisive contribution in this respect, while requiring a strut tower brace in the engine compartment to achieve the ruggedness objectives.", "The components of the double-wishbone front axle are directly mounted to the ladder-type frame without a subframe. The lower wishbone's attachment points on the frame in Z-direction are positioned as high up as possible. This arrangement ensures good driveability beyond the asphalt. Specifically for the G-Class, the new front axle is designed in such a robust way that the off-road performance and off-road capabilities of its predecessor are maintained and partly even surpassed.", "Equipped in this way and with a ground clearance of 270 mm to the front axle gear, the Mercedes-Benz G-Class provides plenty of potential for maximum assertiveness and driving pleasure in terrain. The figures speak for themselves:", "Thanks to the independent suspension, it was possible to improve the rigidity of the body front end. A strut tower brace, known as a suspension bridge, now connects the front strut towers, which increases the torsional rigidity of the ladder-type frame.", "At the rear, in contrast to the predecessor, the new rigid axle is controlled by four trailing arms on each side and a Panhard rod. This makes normal driving on the road even more comfortable. In terrain, the rear spring jounce of 82 mm and rebound of 142 mm plus the ground clearance of 241 mm to the rear axle gear help to ensure a safe ride even in extreme situations.", "DYNAMIC SELECT is now available with up to five driving modes for the G-Class. This allows adjusting the vehicle characteristics in seconds at the touch of a button, as the system modifies the characteristics of the engine, transmission, suspension, steering and assistance systems at the driver's behest. The four programs \"Comfort\", \"Sport\", \"Eco\" and \"Individual\" can be set conveniently via the DYNAMIC SELECT rocker switch. In \"ECO\" mode, a particularly fuel-optimised driving style is possible, for example. In \"Sport\" mode, on the other hand, the shift points of the automatic transmission, the throttle response of the engine, and the parameters of the electric steering system and the exhaust flap are changed. \"Individual\" allows drivers to configure their own preferred vehicle settings.", "DYNAMIC SELECT provides a host of options in combination with the new suspension with optional Adaptive Damping System. The driver is then also able to modify the vehicle's damping characteristics in Sport and Comfort modes using the DYNAMIC SELECT switch.", "Put simply, the G-Class detects the particular condition of the road and sets the appropriate damping characteristics, so that the damping in terrain is stiffer, for example. In contrast, in Sport mode the G-Class boasts a more agile response when driving on the road.", "One of the prerequisites for the improved off-road handling characteristics is the new \"G-Mode\". The Mercedes-Benz G-Class changes to \"G-Mode\" independently of the chosen driving mode as soon as one of the three differential locks has been activated or the LOW RANGE off-road reduction gear has been engaged. This off-road mode adapts the adjustable damping of the chassis and the steering as well as the accelerator characteristic, avoids unnecessary gear shifts and thus ensures optimum control and maximum off-road capability. A small \"G\" icon discreetly lights up in the instrument cluster. The \"G\" swallows rough ground so easily that the driver is able to enjoy inch-perfect manoeuvring even in the steepest terrain and receive excellent feedback on the traction capacity of the surface.", "The specification for the G-Class not only included solidness and superiority in terrain, but also greater driving dynamics and comfort on paved roads. Thanks to the new front axle design, the on-road performance of the G-Class has therefore been enhanced at the same time. On the road, the \"G\" is as agile as it is comfortable and provides the driver with a better steering feel. The off-roader stays on track more solidly, and is agile and effortless when driving off-road.", "Using a digital prototype, the developers simulated the service life of individual components and closed systems to find out in which places it would be possible to make use of lighter raw materials. The diet worked, as the Mercedes-Benz G-Class has shed around 170 kg. The recipe for success: a new mix of materials comprising strong, high-strength, ultra-high-strength steels and aluminium, as well as improved production processes at the Magna Steyr plant in Austria. The rigid body shell is now made of a variety of steel grades, while the wings, bonnet and doors are made of aluminium.", "To be able to retain the door hinges and handles typical of the G-Class, the developers modified these to suit the new aluminium design. The A- and B-pillars are made of high-strength steel due to their load-bearing function. However, less mass in no way translates into less stability - on the contrary, it was possible to increase the torsional rigidity of the frame, body shell and body mounts by around 55 percent, from 6537 to 10,162 Nm/deg. Alongside improvements to the natural driving dynamics and comfort, this also results in enhanced quality in terms of noise levels, among other things, with the positive effect of significantly less noise and vibrations being noticeable in the interior when driving.", "In the new G500 (fuel consumption, combined: 11.1 l/100 km; combined CO2 emissions: 263 g/km) a high-performance 4.0-litre V8 petrol engine ensures powerful propulsion. The new biturbo produces an output of 310 kW (422 hp) and a maximum torque of 610 Nm at 2000 to 4750 rpm.", "For the transfer of power, the 9G-TRONIC automatic transmission with torque converter was specifically adapted to meet the needs of the off-road icon. The developers have managed to reduce the shift and response times of the 9-speed transmission by means of a dedicated software application. The wide transmission ratio not only makes driving quieter and more comfortable especially at low engine speeds, it simultaneously also contributes to reducing fuel consumption.", "As direct as possible, as indirect as necessary", "As standard the G-Class is now fitted with electromechanical rack-and-pinion steering, which now allows driving assistance systems such as Parking Assist to be implemented. In addition, the electromechanical steering uses less energy than a hydraulically assisted steering system. Depending on the driving mode, one of three sets of steering characteristic lines, namely Comfort, Sport and Off-road, comes into effect. This ensures a comfortable or sporty steering feel on the road, but also straightforward and precise feedback in unpaved and demanding terrain - always paired with sufficient steering power assistance. In a nutshell: as direct as possible, as indirect as necessary.", "The Mercedes-Benz G-Class is the top model among luxury off-road vehicles. It is not only the passenger car model series with the longest production run in the history of Mercedes-Benz by far, but also the forefather of all SUVs to bear the three-pointed star - this is why all Mercedes off-road models feature the upper-case G in their name.", "What began in 1972 with a collaboration agreement between then Daimler-Benz AG and Steyr-Daimler-Puch in the Austrian city of Graz is now a story peppered with superlatives and significant milestones. The first concept to be developed was already different. The team designed a vehicle which impressed with superior off-road capability, while at the same time appealing to customers as a full-featured and safe vehicle suitable for recreational purposes. All-wheel drive and 100-percent differential locks have also been part of the \"G\" since that time, as has the robust ladder-type frame.", "At the time of its market launch, in the spring of 1979, it was available with a choice of four engine variants covering a performance range from of 53 kW/72 hp to 115 kW/156 hp. Customers had the option of a Cabriolet with a short wheelbase or Station Wagon models with short or long wheelbase. In 1989 the vehicles of the model series 463 marked the beginning of an evolutionary process for the off-roader that was not just about keeping pace with technical progress. It was an evolution that also brought a steadily expanding fan base and emphasised its character as an exclusive vehicle for any occasion.

But this premiere 30 years ago will be the last for the time of production until 1997 Series invariably apgreidvana of firsts. And for the first time in the winter of 2009, the 124 took its first steps towards becoming a Young Classic. Since 1993, the W124 series was designated the first Mercedes E-Class, this is the first car Mercedes-Benz 4MATIC function with automatic all-wheel drive back in 1985, and in 1990, Mercedes-Benz E 500 was the first midsize model equipped with a V8 engine. These stages provide the framework for a biography of this model series, which appeared not only as Sedan, wagon, coupe and convertible, but also as chassis Sedan long wheelbase versions, and as such served six major players – Mercedes model initiative -Benz.", "The first generation of this midsize sedan made its debut at the end of November 1984 in Seville, Spain. Mercedes-Benz presented the eagerly awaited new saloon (W 124 series) in the upper midsize segment 200 D, 250 D, 300 D, 200, 230 E, 260 E and 300 E. In addition, 200 E version for export to Italy. In terms of design and engineering the number of elements of the 190 model (W 201), the predecessor of the C-Class from 1982. Parallel to the compact class was evident, for example, the use of high-strength steel and other materials to reduce weight.", "Despite the lightweight design engineers Mercedes-Benz, made further safety improvements – thanks in part to innovative methods of design and development. For example, the 124 series is the first model of the vehicle, subject to the Mercedes-Benz not only classic crash tests, but also the computer accident simulation. The passenger cell is extremely rigid in terms of side impact and sustainability and resistance to rollover and is equipped with ingenious front and rear crumple zones. Salon midsize series also meets the criteria for an asymmetrical frontal collision with 40 percent overlap at 55 km / h In addition, potential areas of contact with pedestrians and cyclists were designed to absorb the energy of impact should the situation arise.", "Mercedes E-Class W124", "Developed by Bruno Sacco (Bruno Sacco), Galitzendorf Joseph (Joseph Gallitzendörfer) Pfeiffer and Peter (Peter Pfeiffer), the logic of the design of the saloon was pragmatic and functional. Characteristic rear end, for example, is particularly advantageous in terms of drag. Aerodynamic optimization of the new sedan (drag coefficient of Cd = 0,44 in the W 123 series to Cd = 0,29 or 0.32 in the W 124 series, depending on engine type) reduces fuel consumption significantly compared to previous model. In 1984 there were few differences in design between the powerful six-cylinder models and the four-cylinder variants with moderate power. Externally all models are identical except for the rear silencer with a six-cylinder models with two tailpipes, and additional air vents in the front spoiler and 300 D models equipped with air conditioning.", "Engineers develop from scratch a number of W124 series engines. All new, for example, six-cylinder engines with direct injection models 260 E (kV/170 125 hp) and E 300 (140 hp kVt/190). All three diesel engines for the new Diesel generation of 124 – 200 D (53 kVt/72 hp), 250 D (66 kW / 90 hp) and 300 D (80 kVt/109 hp) – were designed as a modular series. Eccentric-sweep windshield wiper to clean the panoramic windscreen made its debut in the W 124. She cleans 86% of the windscreen – the largest swept area in the world of cars during the launch of the W124. Outstanding ride characteristics on the other hand, are provided by the tried and tested front and rear axle design from the compact class. This incorporated a shock another nest independent front suspension with feature anti-dive control and an independent multi (multi-link/multi-link) rear suspension.", "Mercedes E-Class W124 E500", "The history of the 124 series is characterized by a previously unrivaled variety of models, body styles and innovations. Presentation of the Estate (S124 series of Mercedes E-class) in September 1985 at the International Motor Show (IAA) in Frankfurt is an important step towards expanding 124 family. Estate was largely identical to the Saloons in terms of technological and stylistic design. In addition to changes in the back of the roof and other concomitant changes, there were no differences to the body. The only changes to the major assemblies, braking system and chassis were to adapt to the increased payload, otherwise they are taken from the Saloons virtually unchanged. Depending on the engine, the drag coefficient of the Estate model ranged from Cd = 0,34 to 0,35.", "If possible, the designers incorporated into the Estate the safety standards achieved in the Saloons. In particular, they use the latest findings from research into the safety of the development of the rear overhang of the body of the wagon, a critical area rear ends. One example is the fuel tank, which featured slanting abutting surface. This ensures that in the event of a rear impact in deformation of the rails will bring the tank and it will be displaced downwards cables will be secured cables to avoid contact with the road.", "The close relationship between the sedan and wagon is evident in the engines fitted to them. Genuine Estate range consists of eight models, which – with one exception – used engines that also featured in the sedan. 3.0 – liter six-cylinder turbodiesel engine with 300 TD TURBO output of 105 hp kVt/143 was developed by engineers at Mercedes-Benz based aspirated Saloon unit. In this modified form, the turbocharged compression ignition engine was used in the export version of the 300 SDL from the S-Class.", "Mercedes E-Class 300CE 24V", "In 1987 Mercedes-Benz expanded the model of the 124 series even more. First, in March, two Coupé models made their debut at the Geneva Motor Show, thus the number of body variants on three. As with the 123 series, there were close technical and stylistic similarities with the limousine. However, the basic assembly of these new models was modified so that the coupe wheelbase is shorter by 8.5 cm. This serves to emphasize the sporty character and make the two-door version of a fully independent body, in terms of design and form.", "Reinforced A-pillars, side sills and doors, and a particularly high proportion of high-strength steel is used to compensate for the lack of B-pillars. One characteristic design element that differs from other coupes body variants were the rub strips with integrated chrome strips. Positioned between the wheel arches at bumper height, thus creating a visual link between the front and rear aprons are painted in contrasting colors – metallic.", "Model range initially included the 230 and 300CE. Their engines, a 2.3-liter four-cylinder engine and a 3-liter six-cylinder with mechanically / electronically controlled fuel injection are the same as in the saloon versions. And to all other mechanical components are identical compartments with four doors colleagues. The only visible features that distinguish them from other models were the twin tailpipe of the six-cylinder and place the rear cover plate.", "Mercedes E-Class W124 Convertible", "In September 1991 Mercedes-Benz launches premiered another body variant, the 300 CE-24 Cabriolet, production of which began in 1992. After a break of about 20 years, the middle class once again available four-seater convertible. The car is based on the Coupé, although preparation for the role of a vehicle with a retractable roof has taken significant investment projects. About 1000 parts must be redesigned just to strengthen the chassis. For example, the A-pillars were welded to interior sections of the weakest areas for achieving high strength and hardness.", "Complete safety system is achieved by combining these pillar with an automatic roll bar. Designed specifically for the 300 CE-24 Cabriolet and located behind the rear seats, this linear bar goes almost vertically upwards within 0.3 seconds of turning. Fully retractable soft top incorporates the wealth of ingenious technical detail – including, for example, heated rear windscreen made of safety glass and with a double frame mounted to the outer skin, providing a secure rear view.", "As was common with models of Mercedes-Benz in the previous decades, the Mercedes E-class W124 series chassis is also provided for equipping a specific body depending on the needs of the local or foreign bodies. It could develop into an ambulance and a hearse or other vehicle with special functions. The novelty here is that these chassis were based on the station wagon produced in the same factory in Bremen. In addition to the normal length of the vehicle had a longer long-wheelbase version. Since 1989, there have been long-wheelbase Saloon. This six-door version is 80 centimeters longer than the series Saloon in overall length and wheelbase.", "Mercedes E-Class W124 T-Model – Wagon", "W124 series introduced numerous technological achievements. Among the notable premieres was the introduction of the 4MATIC automatic four-wheel drive in 1985. This system of all-wheel includes complex electronic control unit and an additional front-wheel drive with transfer case and differential. In addition to automatic 4MATIC-wheel drive, the concept of “Mercedes-Benz Dynamic Governance” also includes an automatic locking differential (ASD) and control system acceleration skid (ASR) – which means that in this package Mercedes- Benz offers three speed automatic electronic dynamic control systems – each system uses signals from the anti-lock braking system ABS.", "Also in 1985, the Stuttgart optional system for emission control with three-way catalytic converter for all petrol-engined models in the 124 series except the 200 model equipped with a carburetor. From September 1986 the catalytic converter became standard, and even the carburettor model 124 series is available now on this system to control emissions.", "Mercedes E-Class W124 interior", "During the twelve years of producing the W124 series was regularly improved and further developed by engineers at Mercedes-Benz. This manifested itself in the emergence of new models and technical innovation. They include, for example, 300D Turbo and 300D Turbo 4MATIC saloons, introduced in 1987, with turbodiesel units from the corresponding station wagon models. Then in 1988 at the Paris Motor Show, the 200E (hitherto produced only for the Italian market) and 250D (featuring a modified version of the turbocharged 2.5-liter engine in the compact class-W201).", "In September 1988 Mercedes-Benz introduced diesel engines for the Mercedes E-Class W124 250D and 300D Turbo with redesigned prechambers and oblique injection for more efficient combustion. This reduces emissions of particulate matter (soot), while increasing power. Furthermore, in September 1988, all models are enhanced with standard equipment package, including anti-lock brakes (ABS) and a heated right exterior mirror.", "As part of the “Diesel ’89″ in February 1989 turbocharged diesel passenger cars were equipped with revised engines. They also include new prechambers with oblique injection, which has led to improved levels of emission and power. Emissions are further reduced by using a complex system of emission control (AGR), which combines the oxidising catalytic converter specially designed for diesel engines with a carefully tuned exhaust gas recirculation unit. This highly effective system is available from October 1990 as an option for models with diesel engines and weather six months later for turbocharged models.", "Mercedes E-Class W124", "In September 1989 Mercedes-Benz presented a completely revised model for the midsize category at the IAA International Motor Show in Frankfurt. The focus of the model refinement of stylistic changes in housing and redesigned interior. The most distinctive feature of the facelifted models have plastic side moldings with chrome strip integrated. The new interior design is centered around the new seats and numerous improvements in various details.", "Revised model program for the Mercedes E-Class W124 series offers five brand new models. Now for the saloon, coupe and wagon was the 3-liter, six-cylinder engine with four valves per cylinder and variable camshaft incoming valves taken from model 300 SL-24. But given the different installation conditions it was not possible to install the same catalytic converter in the SL 300 E-24, 300 CE-24 and 300 TE-24 models. Therefore, output was 162 hp kVt/220 – KVt/11.01 8.1 hp less than the sports car (170 hp kVt/231).", "Along with these top models in the series, the Stuttgart company also introduced a fourth body variant in the midsize class – the long wheelbase Saloon. This restored the sales program long version after an absence of four years. Long body was developed in close cooperation with the firm Binz bodies based in Lorch (Lorh) who then care for series production. The wheelbase has been increased by 80 centimeters to 3.60 meters, while also increasing the total length of 80 cm Unlike the preceding models with a long wheelbase version of the 250D and 260 E are six full-size doors and center seat in terms of depth of seat and backrest height nearly matches that of the rear. Serial production of the long saloons began in May 1990.", "Mercedes E-Class W124 AMG", "Exclusively as a saloon, 500E made its debut at the Paris Motor Show in October 1990 – this is the new top model in the 124 series, and the first E-Class equipped with V8 engine. Series production began in February 1991. External 500E at first glance no different to its sister models. It can not be said for the point. The newcomer is equipped with a V8, 5-liter, four-valve engine that produces 240 hp kVt/326.4, which was based on and-tested power unit from the 500 SL and delivered a breathtaking performance. The Saloon mated to a four-speed automatic transmission can reach 100 km / h, a place for 5.9 seconds, top speed is automatically limited to 250 km / h Standard equipment includes skid control (ASR) to prevent slippage of the drive wheels even at full acceleration.", "To improve the quality of the emissions, the amount of double catalytic converter was increased from 3.9 to 5.8 liters, the system is supported by secondary air injection and exhaust gas recirculation. 500E for the first time used a new version of the four-valve V8 engine, featuring a different injection system, fuel injection, modified crankcase, Bosch LH-Jetronic system electronically controlled fuel injection and engine block the same height as the engine block the 4.2 liter version.", "Distinctive features of the 500E include subtly increased overhang wheel arches, fog lamps integrated into the front bumper and 16-inch alloy wheels with eight holes with tires 225/55 ZR 16. The chassis is 23 mm lower than the other models, and to compensate for spring load, the rear axle is equipped as standard with hydropneumatic self-leveling rear suspension.", "Mercedes E-Class W124 Coupe", "Two millionth car from the W124 series rolled off the production line in June 1992. Just a few weeks later, the midsize series is subjected to a second treatment. This time Mercedes-Benz focuses on engine and equipment. The petrol versions are completely revised engine range, now completely to four valves per cylinder. This meant that the four and six-cylinder units now have the same bore, making production more flexible and economical.", "Apart from the new range of petrol engines for model refinement also includes greatly enhanced standard equipment package for all midsize models. In October 1992, standard equipment includes airbags, central locking and electrically adjustable exterior mirrors on both sides. In addition, the four-cylinder models are equipped with five-speed transmission at no extra cost.", "The new model 400E appeared on the European market at the same time as the facelifted midsize models. This variant of the W 124 was produced in September 1991 for export to the U.S. and Japan. As the new top of the range car in the large-displacement models, the car boasts the familiar 4.2-liter V8 engine with four valves per cylinder and 205 kW. / 279 hp.", "In 1993 for the first time in the world of technology has been used four valves per cylinder in five and six-cylinder turbocharged diesel engine. This not only provides increased torque and power, but also reduces fuel consumption at full load up to 8%. Furthermore, optimization of the combustion process meant that exhaust particulate emissions are reduced by 30 percent.", "Mercedes E-Class W124 Tuning", "New nomenclature came into effect for the 124 series from the start of sales of the new revised models in June 1993. According to the S-Class and the new C-Class, the midsize category henceforth renamed the Mercedes E-Class. This means that the model designations were now also change the class to which the vehicle belonged to is represented by a letter of the alphabet. This letter was followed by a three-digit number based as previously on the engine. Coding of body as a coupe and wagon was now abandoned, as they are distinct. In the case of models powered by diesel engine, the words “Diesel” or “Turbodiesel”, placed in three-digit number replaces the earlier cuts. Thus D is 250 E 250 Diesel.", "Along with the change in nomenclature, the most striking feature of the modified vehicles was the radiator grille, redesigned in line with the Mercedes S-Class. The so-called integrated radiator is much thinner chrome frame compared with the previous design, and the Mercedes star was positioned – the saloons of the S-Class – the bonnet. Lighthouse also changed: the front turn signals with colorless lenses are the rear with bi-chromatic coating.", "There were also changes the shape of the boot lid, wheels and bumpers. Steel wheels with six holes and the bumper moldings are now the same color as the rest. The rear bumper molding has come to the rear wheel arch.", "Around that time, a stage E60 AMG as the new top model of the range offered by the company owned tuner has a 6-liter V8 M 119. This sports saloon developing 280 kW / 381 hp at 5600 / min AMG, also revised Coupé and Convertible models: they also appear on the market in 1993 as the E 36 AMG, delivering 200 hp kVt/272 at 5750 / min", "In June 1995, two years after the last facelift, Mercedes-Benz introduced the E-Class saloons of the W210 series, the successor to the 124 series. Production of the W124 series Saloons ended shortly thereafter, depending on the model between June and August 1995. Production of the wagon continued until 1996. Mercedes-Benz also continues to produce CKD (“completely knocked down” – “completely disused”) parts of the Mercedes E-Class E250 and E220 Diesel until 1996 and shipped them for installation of Pune in India. The last of the production line down convertible in 1997.", "For a period of more than eleven years, the production amounted to 2,058,777 sedan, wagon 340,503, 141,498 coupes, convertibles 6343, 2342 sedan with a long wheelbase and 6,398 chassis with partial bodies for special purpose vehicles – a total of 2,555,861 cars.", "With the end of production, the Stuttgart company opened a new chapter in the “auto”-biography of their 124 series. With its classic lines and multiple body variants, the series has begun to establish itself as an attractive young Classic.", "And on his 25th birthday in 2009, the first cars in the series will officially receive the rank of “youngtimer” or recent classics – a piece of automotive heritage with youthful radiance. This is reflected in the information collected by Mercedes-Benz Young Classics collection where dream cars such as the E500 and 300 CE waiting for enthusiasts on a trip down memory lane to relive the history of the Mercedes E-Class W124 series."], "post_order": "#20", "replier_post_ID": []},

These include 150 models of both the SLR 722 Coupé and the SLR 722 S Roadster, as well as 75 exceptionally sporty SLR Stirling Moss special models (Z 199) – a classic speedster without roof or windscreen.

The sporty bonnet with power domes accentuates this urge of forward motion. The windscreen and passenger cell have been moved to the rear for these classic proportions known in the industry as \"cab-backward design\". The preceding model was already a great step forward in terms of a high-value appeal in the interior, and the new C-Class goes even further with respect to modern luxury. The interior adopts highlights from the new S-Class, adding a sporty touch.", "When viewed from the side, elaborately sculptured surfaces create unique light effects. Conversely, the designers have reduced lines to a minimum, which accentuates the so-called catwalk line or shoulder line even more. In the Estate model, the progressive roof line in combination with the inclined rear window adds a sporty touch without functional compromises. Other features producing the sporty, superior appearance include the wide track and the flush 17- to 19-inch wheels in modern designs.", "The brand's hallmark radiator grille characterises the front. All models feature a central star, with the design and character of the radiator grille differing in the details. The base model has a central star and louvres.

In the Saloon, the lamps for the first time have a two-piece design in the", "C-Class, with the light functions divided between the side wall and boot lid lamps. Their precisely configured interiors also showcase the standard of particularly high quality in detail. Optional or line-specific trim in the rear bumper attractively rounds off the rear view. Three new paint finishes – spectral blue, high-tech silver and opalite white – have been added to the colour range.", "The dashboard is divided into an upper and a lower section: into a wing-like section with new, flattened round vents reminiscent of aircraft engine nacelles, and into an opulent expanse of trim. The latter flows from the centre console to the dashboard without interruption. Driver-focus adds to the sportiness: the dashboard and central display are slightly tilted towards the driver by six degrees.", "The driver area features a high-resolution LCD screen.

Its portrait orientation is particularly advantageous for navigation. The touchscreen likewise appears to float above the expanse of trim. Like the dashboard, the screen is slightly tilted towards the driver. The central display has a screen diagonal of 9.5 inches (24.1 cm) as standard.

The door centre panel with integrated armrest evolves from a vertical surface into a horizontal orientation. Reflecting the design of the centre console, the front section takes the form of a metallic high-tech element. It can be used as a grab or closing handle, and houses the power window controls. Another highlight is the floating control cluster, into which the door opener and seat adjustment controls are integrated.", "The special design of the optional AVANTGARDE or sport seats of the new C-Class uses layers and enveloping surfaces to create a visual impression of lightness. The head restraints are a completely new design and are attached to the backrest with a sealed piece of trim under which the adjustment mechanism is located.", "A dashboard covered with man-made leather and featuring nappa-look beltlines is available for the C-Class (optional equipment, standard with AMG Line). The range of available trim showcases innovative surfaces. These include new interpretations of open-pored veneers in brown tones and a black, open-pored wood veneer featuring fine inlays of genuine aluminium that follow the dashboard's contours.", "The driver display and media display offer a holistic, aesthetic experience. The look of the screens can be individualised with three display styles (Discreet, Sporty, Classic) and three modes (Navigation, Assistance, Service).
