Moreover, these photos were taken at a Volvo photo shoot, revealing the S60 with hardly any camouflage! The 2011 S60 made its debut as a thinly-veiled concept car at the 2009 North American International Auto Show.", "When Volvo launched its XC60, design chief Mattin said it marked a whole new styling direction for the company. Judging by the S60 spied today, that certainly appears to be the case. Mattin joined Volvo from Mercedes-Benz in 2005. At Mercedes, he was responsible for the design of the SLR McLaren and the new S-Class, among others.", "In addition to a new design language, the new S60 seems to demonstrate Volvo’s desire to move toward more slender A- and C-pillars for increased visibility. Over the years, these structural supports have become much thicker on most vehicles for structural and styling purposes. Volvo seems to have kept the styling up to snuff, but no word on materials were used to keep up strength.", "The S60 concept’s interior is highlighted by a sculpted crystal slab, which acts as the car’s center console, center stack, and even houses a navigation system. Of course, don’t look for the crystal treatment to make its way into the production S60 as it is purely a conceptual piece developed with Swedish glassmaker Orrefors.", "“The full-size crystal piece in the concept car will not be a production feature. However, it does open up opportunities to use crystal on a smaller scale in the future. We’ll have to see how our customers respond,” said Mattin.", "Although the crystal center piece won’t make it to showrooms, the unit probably does preview the interior’s general shapes and layout. Look for the next-gen S60 to feature a flowing center stack, with integration into the center console and even into the dash – complete with an instrumental-level navigation screen.", "All of that’s great, but what would a Volvo concept car be without new safety technologies? Well, this vehicle is equipped with an promising pedestrian detection system that, among other things, can automatically brake if the driver does not respond to an imminent collision with a person. A production version of the technology, “Collision Warning with Full Auto Brake and Pedestrian Detection,” will be introduced in the 2011 S60.", "The technology can also be applied to the prevention of rear-impact collisions. Studies indicate half of all drivers who crash into the rear of another vehicle do not brake prior to the collision. In such cases, Collision Warning with Full Auto Brake can help entirely avoid a collision if the relative speed difference between the two vehicles is less than 16 mph.", "Other highlights include a ‘Powershift’ dual-clutch automated gearbox, a 180 hp GTDi engine, EPAS (Electric Power Assisted Steering), a ‘DRIVe-Mode’ fuel economy mode, flat underbody panels, and automatic engine start-stop for stop-and-go traffic.", "The next S60 was originally slated to hit the market in early 2010, but the current economic slump is expected to push that launch back at least until mid-2010. No word on when the 2011 S60 might make its public debut, but the upcoming Frankfurt show has apparently been ruled out.\"", "Source: LLN", "Concept - see", ":"], "post_order": "#1", "replier_post_ID": [], "user_location": "Here today, hell tomorrow", "user_gender": "NA", "user_occupation": "NA", "user_messages_count": "552", "user_reaction_score": "738"},

The MINI Clubvan Concept paves the way for an innovative vehicle concept without parallel in the premium small car segment. The MINI Clubman-based concept car, scheduled for its world premiere at the Geneva International Motor Show 2012, combines the driving fun for which MINI is renowned with increased load-carrying capability. The MINI experience will therefore find its way into new areas of life, the brand’s distinctive character gaining new popularity among target groups not previously on the MINI radar.", "The closed-off load area behind the front seats and the opaque rear side windows of the new concept set it apart most strikingly from the MINI Clubman, the platform used as its base. The MINI Clubvan Concept uses its broader skill-set to open up new usage possibilities – both business and leisure. Where a business’s customers, product range or operating environment demand a particular style for its vehicles, this premium model can make the perfect delivery solution.", "For example, a car in the mould of the MINI Clubvan Concept would fit excellently into the fleet of a fashion designer, art gallery owner or catering service. And its abilities as an all-rounder also tick the right boxes for a photographer with a stack of camera, tripod and lighting equipment to ferry around during the week – and bulky sports and leisure gear to pile on board at the weekend. The MINI Clubvan Concept pulls off the trick of blending enhanced practicality and a well-judged lifestyle focus with natural ease. This ability is based on the impressive adaptability that goes to the heart of the MINI brand’s heritage.", "Calls for maximizing the load capacity of the classic Mini began as early as 1960, just a year after the car’s birth; and they were soon heeded. With its 10-centimeter-longer wheelbase (3.94 inches), separate load compartment and split rear doors, the Morris Mini Van was perfectly equipped for commercial use. It also provided the basis for the fully glazed, four-seat Morris Mini Traveller, one of the precursors of today’s successful MINI Clubman. And so, more than 50 years on, the MINI Clubvan Concept sees history repeating itself – albeit in a slightly different order.", "Two seats, five doors, endless usage potential.", "Limiting the car to two seats creates the capacity its owners will need on a day-to-day basis, as well as opening up a whole new world of customization potential. The load compartment of the MINI Clubvan Concept embodies the car’s fresh and rigorous interpretation of the principle used in the classic Mini – of providing the maximum amount of interior space on the smallest possible footprint. The load area reaches from the split rear doors right up to the partition grille behind the two seats. The totally level floor makes full use of the interior’s depth, and that allows the concept car’s load capacity to exceed the maximum achieved by the MINI Clubman.", "Six attachment loops recessed into the load compartment floor use elasticized straps to hold items of varying lengths, heights and widths in place – without the risk of them sliding around. The partition grille, which is fixed securely to the car body, ensures that items stowed in the load compartment are kept safely away from the front seats. The lower section of the partition is made from solid aluminum, while the upper section consists of a silver-colored stainless steel honeycomb grating. The side walls and floor of the load compartment are trimmed in high-quality anthracite-colored cloth. The anthracite roof liner, meanwhile, extends along the full length of the interior. This uniform color scheme emphasizes the pure-bred, practicality-oriented character of the MINI Clubvan Concept.", "Like the MINI Clubman, the MINI Clubvan Concept is a five-door car with a twist. Two front doors for the driver and front passenger, two side-hinged doors at the rear and the rear-hinged Clubdoor on the right-hand side create comfortable access to the interior. The Clubdoor gives owners the option of loading or unloading smaller items from the side of the car as well as the rear.", "The generous levels of space on board the concept car can be exploited in a variety of ways. Commercial users will be particularly pleased to discover the scope for configuring the load compartment to personal requirements. For example, tools and goods can be stored neatly and securely in made-to-measure drawers or shelving units. 12-volt plug sockets in the rear area of the load compartment provide additional practicality.", "Exterior design: shields from prying eyes, cuts a distinctive figure.", "Impressive practicality and the brand’s time-honored style lend the MINI Clubvan Concept its unmistakable character. Sharing the exterior dimensions of the MINI Clubman and boasting cleverly increased storage capacity, the concept car is the first premium model in the small-car-based van segment. The exterior appearance of the MINI Clubvan Concept marks it out immediately as a MINI – and therefore as a premium product. The function-led design modifications have no impact on the car’s proportions and hallmark MINI design language, but they do give customers the opportunity to combine the demands of commercial use with an appreciation of individual style.", "The MINI Clubvan Concept comes with British Racing Green exterior paintwork, which extends to the roof, C-pillars and exterior mirror caps. As is usual for vehicles charged with transportation tasks, the rear side windows of the MINI Clubvan Concept are opaque. Polycarbonate sections – their outer surfaces painted in the car’s body color – and heavily tinted glass for the rear doors make it difficult to see into the load compartment.", "The unbroken paintwork along the car’s flanks offers extensive scope for individualization, which the MINI Clubvan Concept highlights to eye-catching effect. The sealed side windows bear the logo of a sign design company based in the MINI’s native Great Britain. The hand-applied graphics lend the vehicle a personal look. Indeed, the ultra-versatile MINI carries both its cargo and the company’s promotional message with a uniquely stylish verve. The MINI Clubvan Concept presented in Geneva lends this form of customization a piquant authenticity – on two fronts. The British company that has literally left its stamp on the MINI Clubvan Concept creates similar vehicle graphics for its customers. And the MINI Clubvan Concept showcases how these might look when applied to a MINI van."], "post_order": "#1", "replier_post_ID": [], "user_location": "USA", "user_gender": "NA", "user_occupation": "NA", "user_messages_count": "2,093", "user_reaction_score": "679"},

This is one of the finest, most engaging and desirable cars we have driven in ages, a car with a seemingly endless range of ground-covering abilities that elevates it way beyond the common Nissan badge. It’s automotive heaven…", "[image no longer available]", "Yes. It’s really that good. Nissan took us out to its test track in Sendai, a small student town a couple of hours north of Tokyo on the Bullet Train. The circuit is only 2.5 miles long, but it crams an amazing number of different corners – fast, slow, off-camber and sweaty-palm kinks – into a short stretch of tarmac. A Nürburgring-lite, if you like.", "There we hooked up with Kazutoshi Mizuno, former head of Nissan’s sports car racing programme, who warned us about the intricacies of the Sendai circuit and then lobbed us the GT-R’s keys for ten fast-as-you-dare laps.", "[image no longer available]", "One with winged heels! The GT-R is ferociously quick, sucking in the horizon with the kind of pace that makes you radically recalibrate your speed-distance-time triangle. The 3.8-litre bi-turbo engine is a new V6, not related to the fine one used in the 350Z. It’s an amazingly tractable engine, pulling from way down low in the rev band, then energised by the twin IHI turbochargers all the way, uninterrupted, to the 7000rpm redline.", "From launch to 62mph takes just 3.6 seconds. Top speed is a supercar-rivalling 193mph. The gearchange is lightening quick and clean, and those big Brembo brakes are quite brilliant. They stop you like a giant hand firmly pulling you backwards to safety. Mizuno says they’re the best brakes on any production car and Japanese homologation tests say the same. On our experience, we'd be inclined to agree.", "[image no longer available]", "Don't worry, the GT-R has the polished dynamics to use all that power, all that turbo-enhanced performance all the time. Sure, the steering isn’t as sharp or as delicate as a 911’s – the GT-R is 350kg heavier, remember – but it’s linear and the GT-R’s blunt nose instantly changes direction, no questions asked.", "It doesn't understeer, it simply hunkers down and goes where you want it. It’s a car that drives square on its feet rather than always on its toes. Less poetic, perhaps, than its European rivals. But, in this case, faster. And so easy to exploit.", "It is, says Mizuno, the fastest production car in the world around the Nürburgring – according to Nissan, only the bespoke (and out of production) Porsche Carrera GT can lap the daunting German circuit quicker. That’s real-world pace, irrespective of road or weather conditions.", "[image no longer available]", "Oh it’s quick alright – quick enough to make Porsche’s 911 Turbo feel unexciting – but the GT-R’s real appeal is its adaptability. Punt it hard, really hard on a track and the GT-R responds, delivering searing pace, formidable control, a fine and perfectly judged balance and a wonderfully high level of feedback.", "But if you want to drive it across town in rush-hour traffic or halfway across a continent, you simply slot into Drive, settle back into the thickly padded and generously bolstered seats, switch the suspension setting to soft and the GT-R is so easy and effortless, you might just as well be in a Maxima. A very brisk Maxima.", "And that’s core to the Nissan’s magic appeal – its ability to deliver two distinctly different driving characteristics, where the qualities of one don’t compromise the other.", "[image no longer available]", "With just three switches, housed just above the gearlever, at the bottom of the centre of the dash. The left one adjusts the transmission and you choose ‘R’ mode for faster gearshifts. The middle switch adjusts the dampers. Again, you choose R for the sportiest chassis set-up. Those Bilsteins are now on maximum sports setting.", "Finally turn the VDC (Vehicle Dynamic Control – controlling stability and traction controls) switch to R. Which means it’s turned off. Ring up three Rs and you're ready to Race. Flick them back to their default settings and you have a comfy cruiser.", "There’s even a brake-assist function for hills, to avoid rolling backwards unintentionally on those awkward hill starts.", "[image no longer available]", "True, the GT-R’s lines are bold, brutal and intimidating, but its hides a surprisingly roomy and well packaged cabin. There is none of the styling poetry of a Porsche or, even more, a Ferrari, but the Nissan is bank-vault solidly built and - apart from the PlayStation graphics on the ‘multi function meter’ (myriad info read-outs include turbo boost and front/rear torque split, plus steering angle and even a g meter) - it’s coupé conventional.", "[image no longer available]", "Quite simply, the new GT-R is the world’s most multi-faceted supercar. There is no fast car so easy to steer, none so forgiving, no car that has more armoury in its quest to go fast and keep you out of trouble.", "Just as that old GT-R resets the standards for front-engined coupés, so the new one lifts the bar ever higher. An M3 beater? Easily. M5? Think higher. This car is faster, more high-tech, sharper, more capable. Faster than a 911 Turbo on the straight. Or on the circuit. And all for normal 911 money.

The car is absolutely unique. In a world where the computers do make the difference, by keeping faithful to the Chapman mantra - 'simplify then add lightness', Lotus was able to produce a sports car where, except for the engine, ABS, Electronic Brake Distribution (EBD) and Cornering Brake Control (CBC) systems, the only 'brain' dictating the car action is the driver's very own. How fast the Exige S V6 is able to go is very much up to the driver' skills.", "What is remarkable about it is that the Lotus can go really fast. To prove it one just needs to compare the Exige S V6 with the Cayman GT4 and put the same driver at the wheel of both cars in a lap around the Nurburgring circuit. On one hand we have the driver's brain, on the other we have the same driver's brain + the PASM (Porsche Active Suspension Managment) brain doing some of the driver's job by automatically controlling its electronic dampers and therefore the car behaviour on Lane-change movement, Vertical movement, Lateral-acceleration, Brake and Load-change motions.", "It's a LOT of car motions which are kept tidy and clean for the driver by the computer. I feel that not even Colin Chapman could have ever dream or imagined how easily that can be done, with today's technology, thirty years ago when he and Lotus pioneered the introduction of active suspensions in F1. How ironic is that now when one thinks about the Lotus Exige S V6 vs Porsche Cayman GT4 duel?!", "So, here it is a close comparison, as close as it can get (thanks DeDe), between Christian Gebhardt's action driving the Exige S V6 and the Cayman GT4, and the different outcome:", "We really have to prize Lotus for what it has accomplished with the Exige S V6.

Scandinavian minimalism and purity work together with the key ingredients of a sport utility vehicle, defining the SUV for the electric age. Polestar 3 makes the SUV not only more relevant and responsible, but also desirable for all the right reasons.", "“Polestar 3 is a powerful electric SUV that appeals to the senses with a distinct, Scandinavian design and excellent driving dynamics,” says Thomas Ingenlath, Polestar CEO. “It takes our manufacturing footprint to the next level, bringing Polestar production to the United States. We are proud and excited to expand our portfolio as we continue our rapid growth.”", "Polestar 3 premieres a new aerodynamic profile where strong focus has been placed on retaining the hallmarks of an SUV, including a powerful and wide stance. This has been led by subtle yet effective aerodynamic optimisation – including a front aero wing integrated into the bonnet, an aero wing integrated into the rear spoiler, and rear aero blades.", "“This car has been designed as a Polestar from the start and features new defining characteristics for us – like the dual blade headlights, SmartZone and front aero wing,” continues Thomas Ingenlath.", "Materials used inside Polestar 3 have been selected for their sustainability credentials, while raising premium aesthetics and luxury tactility. These include bio-attributed MicroTech, animal welfare-certified leather and fully traceable wool upholsteries. In line with Polestar’s commitment to transparency, a complete life-cycle assessment (LCA) will be completed on Polestar 3 when production begins. Subsequent assessments will follow through its life cycle and work will continue to constantly find ways of reducing its carbon footprint.", "Polestar 3 is the first car from Polestar to feature centralised computing with the NVIDIA DRIVE core computer, running software from Volvo Cars. Serving as the AI brain, NVIDIA’s high-performance automotive platform processes data from the car’s multiple sensors and cameras to enable advanced driver-assistance safety features and driver monitoring.", "The infotainment system is powered by a next-generation Snapdragon Cockpit Platform from Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. As a central component of the Snapdragon Digital Chassis – a comprehensive set of open and scalable cloud-connected automotive platforms – the Snapdragon Cockpit Platform will be utilised to provide immersive in-vehicle experiences with its high-performance capabilities to deliver high-definition displays, premium quality surround sound and seamless connectivity throughout the vehicle.", "With Volvo Cars embarking on a new era of safety, Polestar 3 carries next-generation advanced active and passive safety technology from Volvo Cars as part of its DNA. This includes the latest innovation – interior radar sensors that can detect sub-millimetre movements in the interior of the car, to help protect against accidentally leaving children or pets inside.

Over-the-air (OTA) updates are included to allow for continuous software improvement and the introduction of new features without the need to visit a service point.", "Polestar 3 launches with a dual-motor configuration and a power bias towards the rear. The standard car produces a total of 360 kW and 840 Nm of torque. With the optional Performance Pack, total output is 380 kW and 910 Nm. Adjustable one-pedal drive is included, as well as an electric Torque Vectoring Dual Clutch function on the rear axle – an evolution of what was first developed for Polestar 1. A decoupling function is also available for the rear electric motor, allowing the car to run only on the front electric motor to save energy under certain circumstances.", "Advanced chassis control is provided by dual-chamber air suspension as standard, allowing Polestar 3 to adapt between comfort and dynamic suspension characteristics, and the car can adjust its active damper velocity electronically once every two milliseconds (500 Hz).", "“Our goal was to offer the performance and precision that define all Polestar cars, without compromising the comfort of the daily drive,” says Joakim Rydholm, Polestar’s chief chassis engineer. “To do this, we used new components like the adaptive air suspension to engineer the ‘Polestar feeling’ for this type of car.”", "A 111 kWh battery pack provides Polestar 3 with generous driving range of up to 610 km WLTP[2] (preliminary). The lithium-ion battery features a prismatic cell design housed in a protective aluminium case with boron steel reinforcement and liquid cooling. A heat pump is included as standard, helping Polestar 3 utilise ambient heat for climate- and battery preconditioning. Polestar 3 is also equipped for bidirectional charging, enabling future potential for vehicle-to-grid and plug-and-charge capabilities.", "As with Polestar 2, the list of standard equipment in Polestar 3 is extensive, with few options for easy configuration and simplified production logistics. All versions include air suspension, a full-length panoramic glass roof, all-LED lighting inside and out, retractable door handles with proximity sensing, and 21-inch alloy wheels. The Plus Pack and Pilot Pack are fitted as standard for the first model year and include a raft of premium, luxury and convenience features like a 25-speaker audio system from Bowers & Wilkins with 3D surround sound and Dolby Atmos capability, soft-closing doors, a head-up display and Pilot Assist.", "Available to order from the second quarter of 2023, the optional Pilot Pack with LiDAR from Luminar will add an additional control unit from NVIDIA, three cameras, four ultrasonic sensors and cleaning for the front- and rear-view cameras, providing accurate real-time data about the car’s surroundings especially in the long-range field. This enables enhanced 3D scanning of the car’s surroundings in greater detail and helps prepare the car for autonomous driving.", "The optional Performance Pack sharpens driving dynamics even further and includes the maximum power and torque output (380 kW and 910 Nm), along with performance optimisation for the air suspension, unique 22-inch forged alloy wheels and additional signature ‘Swedish gold’ details.", "Polestar 3 is the first car out on a new all-electric technology base developed by and shared with Volvo Cars.

All too often, manufacturers quote a car's \"dry\" weight (without driver, fluids, or fuel), a metric which bears no resemblance to its weight in working order.", "Calculating a car's operational weight from its dry weight requires that you have a copy of its owner's manual at the ready, in addition to relevant product literature about its various coolants, fluids and oils. This may seem insignificant, but the difference between a test weight and dry weight can be as much as 200 kg (a driver and a full fuel tank account for roughly 140 kg alone); without knowing it, we might be comparing vehicles unfairly.", "Luckily, magazines regularly measure a vehicle's weight for road tests; the result is a more realistic picture of kerb weight. Unfortunately, stark differences between magazines can muddy the waters of our understanding. In the following example, extreme differences in reported kerb weight can be seen:", "Lamborghini Gallardo LP570-4 Superleggera", ": 1592 kg (700 kg front, 892 kg rear)", ": 1484 kg", ": 1542.8 kg (658.6 kg front, 884.2 kg rear)", ": 1493 kg", "The biggest discrepancy is a whopping 98 kg! Most would assume that surely these magazines use different methods for measuring/reporting vehicle kerb weights; a valid assumption were it not for the fact that these same tests were conducted for the Ferrari 458 Italia, which led to the following numbers:", ": 1528 kg (651 kg front, 877 kg rear)", ": 1544 kg", ": 1544.0 kg (657.2 kg front, 886.8 kg rear)", ": 1540 kg", "That's a maximum kerb weight discrepancy of just 16 kg, or just about about one percent. In this instance, the numbers are very consistent. The conclusion we should draw from the Ferrari 458 numbers is that the magazines use the same methodology for reporting or measuring weight - something which sits in stark contrast to the conclusions reached above.", "Clearly, a car's measured kerb weight changes based on fuel level (at a density of 0.755 kg/L, a 90 L fuel tank accounts for about 68 kg of mass) and number of occupants (the agreed-upon standard appears to be 70 or 75 kg). I would therefore like to know exactly how these factors are controlled for in each magazine's measurements. For instance, the DIN standard for kerb weight measurements clearly specifies 90% fuel and no occupants; whereas the EU standard retains the same fuel level and adds a 75 kg driver.", "If we can standardize these measurements, it would be enormously beneficial for making an accurate comparison between vehicles.

If you are inside it is obvious that the new one has less space for the front seats but more space for the back seats; for the trunk, you simply can't compare: the old one has a much bigger and geometricaly regular trunk.

As I don't usually do any road - or track - racing, and having driven both cars, I can vouch for the Benz's superiority as a means of transport whose primary purpose is to get me from point A to point B in maximum comfort.

As a matter of fact I didn't like the beamer's overcommunicative steering at all, I'd rather not know of every single road irregularity, and driven in a straight line, the BMW didn't feel special, unlike the C which felt like a tank, in the good sense of the word. Although I didn't have the chance to drive the beamer through a slalom run, the benz's limits through the run where much further than my own and it did everything I wanted it to do, exactly how I wanted it to do it. If BMW can better that, good for them, but I don't need more. To be quite honest, I have always liked benzes over beamers, I even thought the W203 would have been a better car than E90 if it hadn't been for that TERRIBLE steering with that dead on-center feel, like 2 inches of freeplay, and too much self centering at speed that it felt I was fighting against the car in high speed sweepers.

This is a civil war that is all about power – horsepower that is. The big three automakers, Audi, Mercedes, and BMW have been pumping out a continuous line of monstrous sedans and coupes across the line. But the main focus where this war is most violent is between the super sedans. Audi has a 500hp version of its A6 sedan called the RS6, and then there is the Mercedes AMG E63, and finally, the king of the super sedans, the BMW M5. Sadly however, the RS6 is no longer in the game since it is out of production at this time and won’t return for at least another year. However, the competition is still fierce between BMW and Mercedes.", "Last year, BMW raised the bar yet again with its all-new M5. Previous M5s were nothing short of driving perfection and the absolute best sport sedans in the world – they were also the fastest as well. However since the beginning of this war of the German automakers, the M5’s 400hp was no longer enough. Mercedes’ E55 was pushing out 450hp with the latest E class body; then Audi blew AMG away with the stunning 500hp RS6. BMW wasn’t going to be left at the bottom of the scale, so while the M5 retired for a short time, BMW spent quite a while making sure their new M5 would be nothing short of perfection. With an all-new 507hp V10 this engine is a masterpiece of BMW engineering. The new M5 is a technological showcase as well. Its new SMG gearbox has seven gears, and up to eleven different settings that allow the driver to choose how fast he wants the car to change gears. This transmission is a clutch-less manual, with F1-style paddles on the back of the steering wheel to shift, and in addition it does also offer full-automatic mode. The SMG in the M5 is spot-on, and works very well in this car, unlike the way it performed in the older M3 and Z4. However, there is also a traditional six-speed manual available. In addition to the M5’s long list of techno-gadgets and settings, you can also select how much power the engine produces as well.", "Mercedes responded promptly this year with a revised version of its E55, now named the E63. The change in numbers is prompted by an increase from the former 5.5L V8 up to a 6.3L V8 that now produces 506hp, and 464lb-ft of torque, which is just slightly more than the M5. The E63 now also has a seven-speed gearbox called 7G-tronic that, like the M5, has F1 style paddles on the back of the wheel that allows the driver to change gear. Unlike the M5 however, this gearbox is a proper automatic, and a complete manual transmission is not available because the E63’s torque would ruin any manual gearbox that Mercedes can make.", "Performance wise on paper these cars are almost identical. They both have 0-60 times in under 4.5 seconds and have a limited top speed of 155 mph; and even so, unrestricted both will reach the exciting side of 200 mph. Both of these cars will also reach into the exciting depths of your bank account as well, both start at just over $81,000, and after options, you’ll be pushing nearly six figures for the MSRP. So there you have it, both of these cars are almost identical in just about every way. But how do they drive? I’ve luckily had a chance to drive both of these super sedans, and on the face of it, both of them are just fantastic. Behind the wheel of one of these, it’s easy to forget that you’re actually driving a comfortable four-door sedan because they’re just so fast.", "The great thing about both of these cars is that once your finished with fooling around and smoking tires, they settle down, and become comfortable, great looking sedans that you can drive everyday, and hardly anyone will notice. The E63 is conservatively styled, and only the keen automotive enthusiast will regonize your driving something very special. The M5 on the other hand is a bit more aggressive. The base of the normal 5 series is a dramatic departure from the previous model and its not as conservative as before. Like Mercedes, the BMW styling changes are minimal, but it still is far more noticible on the highway with its large, deep-dish alloy wheels, and aggressive front fascia. It’s not as elegant as the Mercedes but beauty is in the eye of the beholder.", "The E63 on the road is very well planted; you can immediately tell that this car was made for the autobahn. Its V8 has a great exhaust note, and its torque surge is addicting under acceleration. The torque that this engine produces is just mind boggling, and it thrusts you into your seat as the traction control light flashes helplessly to try to keep the tires in check. The great thing about the E63 is that this is a very forgiving car. Mercedes has packed it full of electronics and traction control systems to keep you from loosing control. However, these are almost impossible to completely turn off, and for the experienced driver, they really take away from the driving experience. However, the most disappointing part about the E63 is that the steering is much like that of other E-classes; it’s rather numb and lacks feel. It’s heavier than in other models, and it handles well, but the entire time you still somehow feel distant from the car. Added with all the electronic gadgets that work with this vehicle (which is well over 100 different systems and computers) you don’t feel like you’re the one driving this car anymore.", "In comparison, the BMW M5 is a bit more brutal in its driving experience; that is of course once you get around the iDrive system, and its driving aids as well. Like the Mercedes, this BMW is packed with just as many electronics and traction control systems to keep this car in check. This car is easily one of the most frustrating vehicles to figure out. Yes, it is a technological showcase, but the automated voice from the navigation system doesn’t shut up, and it always talks over your favorite radio station, which you can’t find anyway because its too complicated, the climate control systems are a nightmare to work properly, and you even have to select how much power you want the engine to produce. This takes forever to adjust all these settings, because they are far too difficult and distracting to do while your driving. Of course, once you get used to it and get your settings all dialed in, you can forget them and don’t have to bother with them again, but its still a hassle regardless. The good thing however is there is a way you can get around all this mess if your in a hurry. Located on the steering wheel is a button that just says “M”. Push this, and the engine produces its maximum amount of power, the traction control is switched off, the suspension goes into attack mode, and the gearbox is switched over to manual. That also activates the unique heads-up display that gives you a color-coded rev-counter and speedometer. The engine barks out a fantastic exhaust note, and once I floored it, this car violated me – personally. The seats squeezed my sides in, and it took me by surprise because this wasn’t a gentle squeeze. The first corner I took, the side bolsters push into your sides to keep you from sliding around, and I’ll tell you what, it gives you one heck of a driving experience. This car is hands down one of the most exhilarating cars I’ve ever driven, and under full throttle, it just makes your heart stop, I couldn’t believe how fast it was. This car put a huge smile on my face in a way that the E63 just doesn’t. That doesn’t mean the E63 is a bad car, but it feels more like an executive car, and you just want to cruise in. The M5 on the other hand is just bonkers, and it’s mad; it wants you to trash it and drive it like your hair is on fire.", "Overall, both of these are great cars. But once you get around the complications of the BMW’s iDrive system, it delivers a driving experience that the E63 will never do, and for that reason, I’ll take the M5 every time."], "post_order": "#1", "replier_post_ID": [], "user_location": "NA", "user_gender": "NA", "user_occupation": "NA", "user_messages_count": "3", "user_reaction_score": "7"},

Audi is aesthetically boring, unrefined at high speed, FWD and just feels strangely unwieldy.

All the German cars have a certain unholy combination of being aggressive yet simultaneously average to behold - I think it's the angular lines and black everywhere in the interior that does it. I loved the Jag, the ride was amazing, it was refined at high speed, handled very well. I don't particularly care that a 7 footer might bump his head in the rear seat, and I don't care about the 4mpg extra a 520d gives me over an XF2.2 L - the XF 2.2d is faster and if I've got enough money to spend on one of these cars those kind of differences don't even touch the sides. No - the reason the Jaguar is the best is because they've understood why people buy these kind of cars and not a VW, a Prius or a Mondeo.

In Dynamic mode, the bypass valves default to straight-through drama at all speeds, meaning that every inch travelled is accompanied by an ear-splitting eight-pot mewl or off-throttle pop.", "It is of such melodramatic, look-at-me quality that you’d most likely shy away from extolling its virtues in the company of others – and then leave it permanently turned on when alone.", "As with its appearance, the bombastic soundtrack leaves its rival trailing. The far more expensive 911, on its widest available track with 305-section rear tyres and retractable wing, looks as imposing on the road as it does on a spec sheet.", "But the 552bhp twin-turbocharged 3.8-litre flat six stays resolutely buttoned down, transporting you from standing start to beyond the horizon with the expediency of a flash drive.", "Refined progress comes naturally to the Porsche. It would permit you to absent-mindedly study the concrete pylons on the Second Severn Crossing at 150mph. Its high-speed stability is remarkable, and the way that it simmers intimately on adaptive dampers and 20-inch wheels is testament to the engineers’ intentions for its use.", "However, strike a swollen catseye or the wrong type of crease and the Porsche’s chassis will momentarily bridle. The Turbo’s ride quality is a tightrope act designed to stay bolt upright on varnished autobahns, but a cruddy British motorway is not beyond upsetting the balance.", "The F-type, as you might expect from a car tweaked a stone’s throw from the M40, is better equipped to deal with our arterial patchwork. Not for it the over-sprung twang of wheel meeting impediment. This is a Jaguar, after all, and it rides like one.", "The resulting lope is an essential element retained from the roadster but, with telltale tremors gone, more obviously honed. A marginal raising of spring rates doesn’t stop the R from riding better in Dynamic mode, though, the extra body control adding directness to its lane changes and steeling the car against irresistible changes in pace.", "Interacting with the V8’s 502lb ft via the exceptional ZF-supplied eight-speed automatic gearbox turns out to be so invigorating that a gap opens organically from it to the chasing pack, and the F-type is first through the toll gates and into Wales – and, correspondingly, half a length ahead in the running order by the end of the first day’s play.", "Day two takes us to the countryside north of Sennybridge and into the opening salvo of showers, each a mobile, malicious fog of Brecon perspiration. First up on this slippery proving ground is the Porsche, spinelessly chosen for the steadfastness displayed 24 hours earlier. In that respect, it doesn’t disappoint. Only a corpse would claim to be totally unmoved by the first hyper-extended knee bend of the morning, and the way that the Turbo shifts this straight-line thrust into lateral forcefulness is initially baffling.", "Iron will plays its part. The chassis, and its colossal footprint, are presented to the driver almost as agents of obstinacy. Channelled by heavy, direct steering and with adaptive suspension that permits almost no body roll at all, you fire into bends with the dynamic engine mounts bolted down, 553lb ft of torque (on overboost) furiously vectoring and, come the exit, as much power at the front as is being sent to the back.", "There is adhesiveness, then, and giddying pace to go with it. But neither can alleviate the bloodlessness for which the Turbo is famous. Even with a damp, empty moor laid on, adjustability and playfulness are secondary concerns. Driving it is like embarking on army manoeuvres: all the wearing physicality of battle without any of the live ammo catharsis.", "Through the Jaguar F-type's seatbacks, there’s the sense of a less tenacious hold on the road without a driven front axle to share the drive burden, and where moisture persists, the traction shortfall is obvious. But, in contrast to the open-top V8 F-type, there’s a kernel of firm confidence in everything that the new coupé does.", "Its unremitting power delivery no longer seems daunting. Flooring the convertible could feel like a dicey exercise, but in the R coupé, for all its wheel-spinning potential, the even higher output seems tailor-made and keenly deployable. Having more faith in the monocoque’s ability to harness the source of all the evocative noise is key and, as the miles rack up, the car’s exuberance begins to tell.", "The lightly fettled steering, superficially insubstantial, becomes meticulous when pushing on. Sitting, as you do, just forward of the F-type’s rear axle, such accuracy is essential to allowvyou to position the long nose that bit more sweetly.", "From there, in almost any corner imaginable, the beautifully resolved chassis takes over. Best experienced with some of the electronic shackles loosened (TracDSC readily obliges), the R flaunts its sublime front-engined, rear-drive balance at every opportunity, clamping you to an apex only for as long as you desire before a slither of extra throttle has the biddable back end changing attitude.", "If that sounds like the reactiveness granted to any grunty rear-drive car, think again. The subtlety and obedience of the breakaway isn’t far short of astounding. And as the R, via its second-generation E-diff, is so good at telegraphing its whereabouts, you’re free to dip in and out of the excess as much as you like.", "That choice is at the heart of what makes the car so special. Its all-wheel-drive rival wants you to make its engineered statement of intent come true. The faultlessly fast 911 Turbo wishes to function as the ultimate salve to the contemporary headache of A to B.", "Not once does the Jaguar stop feeling like an event. It’s easy to get carried away when it can barely be got into, or out of, without a moment being taken to reappraise just how unspeakably pretty it is, but its specialness isn’t diluted by either a traffic-clogged return journey or the distance of retrospect.", "Its huge, atmospheric pace and rousing handling at one end would be less remarkable were they not mingled so keenly with a sense of genuine companionability at the other.", "It is that breadth of ability and the almost quixotic insistence that you enjoy yourself at every turn which makes the F-type R coupé not only the most compelling sports car on sale but also one of the best, period.", "£85,000", "4.2sec", "186mph", "25.5mpg", "259g/km", "1650kg", "V8, 5000cc, supercharged, petrol", "542bhp at 6500rpm", "502lb ft at 3500rpm", "8-spd automatic", "£140,000", "3.1sec", "197mph", "29.0mpg", "227g/km", "1605kg", "6 cyls horizontally opposed, 3800cc, twin-turbo, petrol", "552bhp at 6500-6750rpm", "516lb ft at 2100-4250rpm", "7-spd dual clutch automatic"], "post_order": "#1", "replier_post_ID": [], "user_location": "NA", "user_gender": "Male", "user_occupation": "NA", "user_messages_count": "7", "user_reaction_score": "8"},
