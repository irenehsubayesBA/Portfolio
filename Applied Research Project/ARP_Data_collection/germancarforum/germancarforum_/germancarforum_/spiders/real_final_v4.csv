Motorsports,Analysis - top teams pass notes to improve overtaking,post-335880,"Oct 6, 2008",Family Guy,"The 2009 Formula One season could see a lot more passing manoeuvres thanks to a unique collaboration between three of the sport’s leading teams. Backed by the FIA, top design engineers from Ferrari, McLaren and Renault worked together to help frame changes to the aerodynamic regulations that should make overtaking far less of a rarity.,Under current regulations, a driver typically needs to be as much as two seconds a lap faster than the car in front to have a realistic chance of passing. That should be cut to around a second next year thanks to a host of bodywork changes, including wider front wings that can be adjusted by the driver from the cockpit - a Formula One first.,Instigated by the FIA at the beginning of 2007, the Overtaking Working Group (OWG) - comprising Ferrari’s Rory Byrne, McLaren’s Paddy Lowe and Renault’s Pat Symonds - used McLaren’s advanced Formula One simulator to evaluate overtaking at Turn 1 of the old Barcelona circuit. Having established the existing ‘two seconds per lap’ requirement, they set about cutting that in half through aerodynamic changes.,They quickly learned that previous FIA proposals aimed at increasing overtaking, in particular the planned Centreline Downwash Generating (CDG) rear wing, had some major flaws. Utilising a conventional wind tunnel rather than computer-based Computational Fluid Dynamics, they instead came up with a series of new measures which should guarantee the desired effect.,The most obvious changes to the cars will be a taller and narrower rear wing, a shorter rear diffuser, and the loss of bodywork appendages such as deflectors, winglets and chimneys. Perhaps the most interesting revision, however, is to the front wing, which will become much wider. It will also be Formula One racing’s first (legal) moveable aerodynamic device, with the driver able to fine tune its settings from the cockpit.,“The flap will be controlled and monitored by the standard ECU,” explains OWG member Paddy Lowe. “The software in this unit is FIA-controlled, so it will only allow two adjustments per lap. The number of settings available to the driver will be up to the team, but the maximum flap angle range is +/- 3 degrees (i.e. 6 degrees total), so probably a team might provide one-degree steps.”,Having achieved their target of the ‘one second per lap’ requirement, it remains to be seen how the OWG’s measures will perform during an actual Grand Prix. Have they got the balance right? After all, many will rightly argue that overtaking in Formula One - the world’s premier motorsport series -,be difficult.,“In my view the reduction from two seconds to one is a very big and important step,” says Lowe. “We may indeed find that this is sufficient. Clearly a zero second per lap differential is nonsensical, so it is not as though we only made half the necessary progress! I also do not believe we want to make overtaking trivial if your car is at all faster - i.e. if we reduced that same number to 0.2sec/lap, say, then it would almost guarantee that any faster car could overtake any slower car without delay - a really quite boring prospect.”,It’s clear the changes should make for even more exciting racing, but that doesn’t mean they will make life any easier for the drivers. They already have a myriad of controls to deal with from the cockpit and next year will see the addition of not only adjustable wings but also KERS, the Kinetic Energy Recovery System (which could also boost overtaking).,As Lowe succinctly puts it, “Switch 'real estate' on the steering wheel is becoming as difficult to find as it is in the cockpit of a 747!”",#1,,,"Melbourne, Australia",NA,NA,177,20,Audi R8 V12 TDI,,NA

We have a chance of winning a world championship but only if the others keep messing things up like they are doing for the entire season. It is thanks to the really great and consistent performances of the drivers in every race that the team is placed second in the championship (and this time without penalties for other teams), but they also must take the next season into account, because the cards could be mixed seriously due to the new regulations. And I really hope that next year we will be as fast as ferrari and McLaren, because when it depends on the drivers I know it's possible to become world champion agian, we'v' been waiting for this since 1983!,So good luck to the entire team for the next weekend, I know i'll be watching it,and hoping for a second victory",#2,,"Nov 12, 1979

Motorsports,2011 F1 proposals,post-202556,"Jun 28, 2007",Porsche Guy,"I usually refrain from posting but I feel the need to step in here. What the FIA is proposing is better than what is currently going on in F1.,First off, downforce and drag are directly proportional as drag is a byproduct of downforce. A steeper wing gives more drag and more downfoce. You can't get rid of drag and increase downfoce. It just doesn't work that way. F1 is all about compromise. Do you create extra drag for the sake of downforce or do  you lose grip for better straight line speed? While I like the extremes teams go to create intricate areo packages, they don't give the spectator a close race and since I'm not racing the car, why should I care about this? I want to be entertained which means I want close racing. What is fun about watching one car stay in the lead the entire race? F1 technology is cool but it has increasingly led to insanely delicate cars in terms of optimum performance. Look at Indy, Alonso couldn't pass Hamilton because he would lose too much grip/downforce while following close enough to pass. When F1 changes the rules in the future, don't think that all of the insane technology we see today is going to disappear. It's going to still be there. It may be focused in other areas than areo packages, but F1 has always been about pushing technology to the limit and it will continue to do so regardless of the rules. Bottom line, F1 in its present form is not a competitive sport. There is one or two teams who dominate the entire season. I want closer racing. I want everyone on the grid to have a chance of winning the race or getting pole position. That just doesn't happen today.,F1 cars are always at the limit of acceptable weight. More costs? F1 is expensive no matter what. AWD could lead to faster cars as they would be able to put down more power sooner coming out of turns. Four wheels break traction less than two. Spec-ing will lead to closer racing.",#8,post: 202084,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1,360","1,021",,,NA

Motorsports,Question: Why isn't F1 popular in the States ?!,post-110789,"Nov 6, 2006",donau,"I think the reasons mentioned so far are all true and part of the explanation.,Another little detail that helps Nascar's popularity here is that the drivers for the most part come across as great guys. When they are interviewed on TV after the race or at any other time, these guys know how to put a face and a character across that is really appealing. Whether it's all sincere or just put on for the media is beside the point, it works. Many look upon them as role models because of their characters. When The Man in the black number 3 car (Dale Earnhardt) got killed a few years ago and the funeral was held in Charlotte, at least in this area it was like Elvis had died.,When I think of the few Formula 1 drivers like Mika Hakkinen and Kimi Raikkonen, both of whom I had great hopes for both for the track and for being individuals that would positively promote the sport, what comes to mind first is Mika's condescending attitude towards some of his fellow drivers like David Coulthardt and Michael Schumacher(don't care to remember the details) and Kimi's latest one liner that made headlines. Of course Kimi and Mika aren't the only ones who did not know how to put on a face that sells, I have heard others here in the US say the same thing about the F1 drivers not being all that likeable compared to their Nascar counterparts.",#8,,"Apr 29, 1954

I particularly enjoy open cockpit racing in various forms - LeMans, Formula 1, CART, IRL, etc.,As an Audi fan, I have particulary enjoyed LeMans and the ALMS series. The preformance and dominance of the R8 is the stuff of legends. The new R10 seems poised to pick up the baton without losing a beat.,A remarkable engineering achievement, the R10 is the first Diesel to win the 24 hours of LeMans and several ALMS series races in its first year. It is particularly poignant in today's uncertain fossil fuel environment that the R10, an engineering tour de force, uses a more efficient fuel source, achieving outstanding power, fuel economy and reliability.,Oh yeah, did I mention that it keeps winning?,Well, now it seems that the ALMS governing body (and Dyson Racing) want to change the rules to handicap the R 10. It is their hope that allowing Dyson a 65 kg weight allowance and a larger fuel tank will even things up.,Rules be damned, if somebody looks too good, we'll just change them. Audi, a major contributor to the ALMS, and the only major-brand factory team in P1 is understandably upset by this decision. Dyson seems to like the change - go figure.,I am firmly in Audi's camp on this one.,This isn't some SCCA event or handicapped drag race.

Motorsports,Kimi to leave Ferrari - reports,post-206464,"Jul 9, 2007",Mr.Link,"My point on Kimi Raikkonen is, He is a Brilliant driver! Agreed he has'nt had a title and in recent times has been all over the negative side but the guy has talent pretty much matched upto the nicest guys on the grid. I think in 2003 he missed out on WDC by 2 points on MS right? A lot of it contributed to un-reliable MCL's and I guess some to his luck/fate and the same happened in the year 2005 which I know Luca di Montezemolo  (apologies for the spelling) has openly said that Kimi would have won if it was not for his un-reliable car. And also Michael while leaving again specified he too was happy with the choice and it was their first and only choice. (I know a lot of these words are probably for PR),Ferrari definately have tons of faith Kimi and as far as I can see I think they would not really look at Alonso as their driver and anything coming from the press about them thinking of sacking kimi or kimi leaving ferrari are just Page 3 stories to fill their empty spaces. I maybe wrong on a lot of all this but Kimi will make his space in one of the greatest F1 drivers and I still want him to go back to Mclaren Mercedes!!,P.S A little offtopic NarutoRamen you like Neha Dhupia?

Motorsports,Hamilton: don’t believe the hype -formula 1-,post-217130,"Aug 10, 2007",hussein,"After days of sensationalist media claims that he is ‘at war’ with McLaren team mate Fernando Alonso, Lewis Hamilton has moved to quell what he insists are misleading stories.,It follows last weekend’s Hungarian Grand Prix, in which Alonso was penalised for impeding Hamilton during qualifying. As a result, the Englishman - who admitted he had disobeyed a team order to move over for the champion during the session - inherited pole position and went on to win the race. Alonso finished only fourth.,Since then, the press - particularly in Britain and Spain - has been full of stories suggesting the drivers are no longer talking. However, Hamilton has now taken the unusual step of releasing a press statement through McLaren to refute the claims once and for all.,“For the record, Fernando and I are fiercely competitive and respectful of each other,” he said. “We are both ambitious drivers who want to win. However, we are not drivers at war, as has been widely reported.,“Although we did not speak on Sunday we have spoken since the weekend and continue to have a professional working relationship. In fact, Fernando and I plan to meet up over the holiday period.”,Hamilton also denied stories suggesting he had used inappropriate language with team boss Ron Dennis and expressed his disappointment that the press had chosen to publish what he described as “inflammatory and untrue material”.,“As an individual in my first year in Formula One I have done my utmost to conduct myself in a professional and open manner,” said Hamilton. “Of course, I have made mistakes, not least during the last weekend, and those are open to public scrutiny. I have my own regrets and have dealt with matters arising.,“However, it is disappointing that inflammatory and untrue material is given to the media and published which may damage reputations. This inflammatory material is then commentated on by many others as if it is factual.,“Whilst I wouldn't normally communicate through press statements, I felt it important to set this matter straight."",Hamilton leads the drivers’ championship by seven points from Alonso",#1,,,BELL CALIFORNIA,NA,you mean my future job = I DUNNO GOOD QUESTION THO,178,37,"ill  get in the future a all new audi rs4,my future car is the 2009 audi rs4",NEVER LET SPEED TAKE OVER YOU,NA
