Motorsports,Celebrating 40 years since the first Porsche victory at Le Mans,post-466336,"Jun 11, 2010",Giannis,"On 14 June 1970, Porsche claimed the first of what would become 16 overall victories in the world’s most prestigious endurance race, the Le Mans 24 Hours. After precisely 4,607.811 kilometres – or 343 laps – Hans Herrmann and Richard Atwood were first across the finishing line in the legendary Porsche 917 KH from Porsche Salzburg, which bore the starting number 23. Gerard Larrousse and Willy Kauhsen in the Martini Porsche 917 LH, followed by Rudi Lins and Helmut Marko in the Porsche 908/02 took second and third places respectively, making it a total triumph for Porsche.,However, the road to this victory was by no means an easy one for Porsche. The Zuffenhausen sports car manufacturer had been racing at the Sarthe circuit since 1951, achieving numerous class wins thanks to intrinsic Porsche qualities such as lightweight construction, aerodynamics and reliability. In 1969, Porsche was pipped to the post in the closest ever Le Mans race, with Herrmann and Larrousse in the Porsche 908 finishing just 75 metres – around one second – behind the Ford GT 40 of Jacky Ickx.,In the anniversary year of 1970, all the signs pointed towards an offensive that would finally see the much longed-for overall victory in Le Mans go to Stuttgart. The Porsche 917 was destined for victory, having made its debut just a year earlier. On 21 April 1969, the 25 Porsche 917s were approved by the homologation commission in Zuffenhausen. The cost of materials alone exceeded DM 5 million. The Porsche 917, developed by Ferdinand Piëch, was unveiled at the Geneva Motor Show. This new ‘ultimate’ Porsche quickly caused a stir among rival competitors. Weighing in at close to the minimum weight of 800 kilograms, it went on to become one of the fastest and most successful racing cars of all time. The lightweight 12-cylinder engine delivered up to 580 hp at 8,400 rpm with a displacement of 4.5 litres. This enabled the long-tail version to reach speeds approaching 400 km/h (248 mph) on the 5,823 metre-long Hunaudières straight at Le Mans.,In the run-up to the 1970 race, it was clear that the lessons learned from previous years had been worthwhile. Realising that rash manoeuvres in the first few hours of this classic endurance race would ultimately end in failure, Porsche made the experienced Hans Herrmann its first choice as driver. The Sindelfingen veteran combined speed and good sense. Together with Englishman Richard Attwood, he started in the 4.5-litre short-tail version bearing the number 23, which was painted in the red and white colours of Porsche Salzburg. The team’s second car, featuring a 4.9-litre engine and long-tail body, was driven by Vic Elford and Kurt Ahrens. A further three Porsche 917s were entered by John Wyer along with the psychedelic-coloured 4.5-litre long-tail version of the Martini team. There was also an entire armada of 907, 908, 910, 911 S and 914/6 models. At precisely 4 p.m. on 13 June, 24 Porsche cars stood at the starting line in Le Mans. By the next day there were still 12 remaining, five of which were classified. The only other cars to be classified were two Ferrari 512 S – this was out of a total field of 51 starters.,This race went down in history – and not just from the perspective of Porsche – because of the disastrous weather. Vic Elford recalled how it was sometimes impossible to overtake, even on the long straights. Kurt Ahrens described it as being like sitting in a boat. And just a few weeks after his victory, Hans Herrmann admitted that driving in the rain had prompted him to make the decision to finally hang up his helmet no matter what the outcome. When leaving his house in Sindelfingen-Maichingen, his wife had asked him when he was going to give up driving, to which he responded: “When I win.”,A promise is a promise. An hour after the start, which saw the drivers begin the race sitting in their cars instead of performing the world-famous “Le Mans start”, Herrmann was only in ninth place. The race leader was Jo Siffert, also in a Porsche 917, followed by Jacky Ickx in a Ferrari 512 S. Siffert later missed a shift and blew his engine, while Ickx crashed his red racer at the chicane. At around 6:15 p.m. came the almost unbelievable news that four Ferrari 512 S had crashed into one another in the driving rain and were out of the race. The race also took its toll on the Porsche armada, with all three 917s of the Gulf team gradually dropping out.,Now was the moment for the experienced veteran Herrmann, who had the perfect partner in Richard Attwood, to show what he could do. Under the most difficult weather conditions, he gradually moved his way up the field, guiding the Porsche Salzburg 917 confidently to the first ever overall victory for Porsche at Le Mans. He realised the significance of this moment as the race came to an end on 14 June 1970: “Wow! That may have been your last lap ever as a racing driver.” Back home in Stuttgart, his victory was celebrated with a parade, in which he drove his winning car through the city to the market square. Thousands of people turned out to congratulate Hans Herrmann, ex-racing driver.,Porsche followed up this success with a further 15 overall victories at Le Mans, the second coming just a year later in 1971. In a unique Porsche 917 with a lightweight magnesium chassis, Gijs van Lennep and Dr. Helmut Marko drove to victory on a still largely chicane-free circuit. In doing so, they set an incredible record, which has never been broken. The Porsche 917 completed precisely 5,335.313 kilometres and 397 laps in 24 hours, clocking up an average speed of 222.304 km/h (138.140 mph) despite all of the pit stops and the long night. The fastest lap in the race was achieved by Jackie Oliver’s Gulf 917, with an unbelievable 244 km/h (151.6 mph) average speed, while the 917 long-tail Coupé of Elford/Larrousse was clocked at a maximum speed of 386 km/h (239.8 mph) on Hunaudières in 1971.,In 1976 and 1977 the Porsche 936 was victorious, while in 1981 it won again under Jacky Ickx and Derek Bell with a new turbo engine. Belgian driver Ickx won at Le Mans six times, four of them in a Porsche. In 1982 he was yet again part of the winning team in a triple victory that represented the first milestone for the most successful racing car of all time, the Porsche 956. Up to 1994, different variants of the 956/962 won at Le Mans seven times. 148 of these were produced in Weissach.,In some years, Porsche conceded the most important race of the year to customer teams, who emerged as frequent winners. Klaus Ludwig and the Whittington brothers thus achieved victory in Le Mans in 1979 with a Porsche 935 for the Cologne-based Kremer team, while Reinhold Joest guided the Porsche brand to well-deserved overall victories in 1984, 1985 and 1997.,Faced with the strongest ever field to line up at Le Mans in June 1998, Porsche racing director Herbert Ampferer spoke at the time of the “race of the century”. Porsche was represented with two new 911 GT1s and achieved a stunning double victory for the factory in the world’s most important endurance race, in front of a crowd of 250,000 thrilled spectators. This was the 16th and most recent overall victory for Porsche at the Sarthe circuit.,From 10 to 11 July 2010, Porsche will be celebrating this special motor sports anniversary in suitable style by taking part in the “Le Mans Classic”, an event which is only held every two years. In six classes covering model years 1923 to 1979, around 400 historic racing cars will gather to relive their old racing triumphs once more. Among them will be some of the overall winners from the Porsche Museum, which will lead an anniversary parade on the race track. Many famous drivers including Hans Herrmann and Richard Attwood will also be taking part and will be available for autograph sessions.,Hans Herrmann/Richard Attwood,Porsche 917 KH,Helmut Marko/Gijs van Lennep,Porsche 917 KH,Jacky Ickx/Gijs van Lennep,Porsche 936,Jacky Ickx/Jürgen Barth/Hurley Haywood,Porsche 936,Klaus Ludwig/Bill Whittington/Don Whittington,Porsche 935 K3 Kremer,Jacky Ickx/Derek Bell,Porsche 936 81,Jacky Ickx/Derek Bell,Porsche 956,Al Holbert/Hurley Haywood/Vern Schuppan,Porsche 956,Klaus Ludwig/Henri Pescarolo,Porsche 956 Joest,Klaus Ludwig/Paolo Barilla/John Winter,Porsche 956 B Joest,Derek Bell/Al Holbert/Hans-Joachim Stuck,Porsche 962 C,Derek Bell/Al Holbert/Hans-Joachim Stuck,Porsche 962 C,Yannick Dalmas/Mauro Baldi/Hurley Haywood,Dauer-Porsche 962 LM,Manuel Reuter/Davy Jones/Alexander Wurz,TWR Joest-Porsche WSC95,Michele Alboretto/Stefan Johannson/Tom Kristensen,TWR Joest-Porsche WSC95,Allan McNish/Laurent Aiello/Stéphane Ortelli,Porsche 911 GT1 98,Many photos availiable here:",#1,,,Greece,NA,Civil Engineer,"17,607","13,475","'05 Volvo S60 2.0T,'02 BMW 520i (E39),'90 Renault Clio 1.4 RT","A fan of old school lift-off oversteer french hatchbacks, proper steering feedback and manual gearboxes.

Motorsports,Analysis - top teams pass notes to improve overtaking,post-335880,"Oct 6, 2008",Family Guy,"The 2009 Formula One season could see a lot more passing manoeuvres thanks to a unique collaboration between three of the sport’s leading teams. Backed by the FIA, top design engineers from Ferrari, McLaren and Renault worked together to help frame changes to the aerodynamic regulations that should make overtaking far less of a rarity.,Under current regulations, a driver typically needs to be as much as two seconds a lap faster than the car in front to have a realistic chance of passing. That should be cut to around a second next year thanks to a host of bodywork changes, including wider front wings that can be adjusted by the driver from the cockpit - a Formula One first.,Instigated by the FIA at the beginning of 2007, the Overtaking Working Group (OWG) - comprising Ferrari’s Rory Byrne, McLaren’s Paddy Lowe and Renault’s Pat Symonds - used McLaren’s advanced Formula One simulator to evaluate overtaking at Turn 1 of the old Barcelona circuit. Having established the existing ‘two seconds per lap’ requirement, they set about cutting that in half through aerodynamic changes.,They quickly learned that previous FIA proposals aimed at increasing overtaking, in particular the planned Centreline Downwash Generating (CDG) rear wing, had some major flaws. Utilising a conventional wind tunnel rather than computer-based Computational Fluid Dynamics, they instead came up with a series of new measures which should guarantee the desired effect.,The most obvious changes to the cars will be a taller and narrower rear wing, a shorter rear diffuser, and the loss of bodywork appendages such as deflectors, winglets and chimneys. Perhaps the most interesting revision, however, is to the front wing, which will become much wider. It will also be Formula One racing’s first (legal) moveable aerodynamic device, with the driver able to fine tune its settings from the cockpit.,“The flap will be controlled and monitored by the standard ECU,” explains OWG member Paddy Lowe. “The software in this unit is FIA-controlled, so it will only allow two adjustments per lap. The number of settings available to the driver will be up to the team, but the maximum flap angle range is +/- 3 degrees (i.e. 6 degrees total), so probably a team might provide one-degree steps.”,Having achieved their target of the ‘one second per lap’ requirement, it remains to be seen how the OWG’s measures will perform during an actual Grand Prix. Have they got the balance right? After all, many will rightly argue that overtaking in Formula One - the world’s premier motorsport series -,be difficult.,“In my view the reduction from two seconds to one is a very big and important step,” says Lowe. “We may indeed find that this is sufficient. Clearly a zero second per lap differential is nonsensical, so it is not as though we only made half the necessary progress! I also do not believe we want to make overtaking trivial if your car is at all faster - i.e. if we reduced that same number to 0.2sec/lap, say, then it would almost guarantee that any faster car could overtake any slower car without delay - a really quite boring prospect.”,It’s clear the changes should make for even more exciting racing, but that doesn’t mean they will make life any easier for the drivers. They already have a myriad of controls to deal with from the cockpit and next year will see the addition of not only adjustable wings but also KERS, the Kinetic Energy Recovery System (which could also boost overtaking).,As Lowe succinctly puts it, “Switch 'real estate' on the steering wheel is becoming as difficult to find as it is in the cockpit of a 747!”",#1,,,"Melbourne, Australia",NA,NA,177,20,Audi R8 V12 TDI,,NA

We have a chance of winning a world championship but only if the others keep messing things up like they are doing for the entire season. It is thanks to the really great and consistent performances of the drivers in every race that the team is placed second in the championship (and this time without penalties for other teams), but they also must take the next season into account, because the cards could be mixed seriously due to the new regulations. And I really hope that next year we will be as fast as ferrari and McLaren, because when it depends on the drivers I know it's possible to become world champion agian, we'v' been waiting for this since 1983!,So good luck to the entire team for the next weekend, I know i'll be watching it,and hoping for a second victory",#2,,"Nov 12, 1979

Motorsports,2011 F1 proposals,post-202556,"Jun 28, 2007",Porsche Guy,"I usually refrain from posting but I feel the need to step in here. What the FIA is proposing is better than what is currently going on in F1.,First off, downforce and drag are directly proportional as drag is a byproduct of downforce. A steeper wing gives more drag and more downfoce. You can't get rid of drag and increase downfoce. It just doesn't work that way. F1 is all about compromise. Do you create extra drag for the sake of downforce or do  you lose grip for better straight line speed? While I like the extremes teams go to create intricate areo packages, they don't give the spectator a close race and since I'm not racing the car, why should I care about this? I want to be entertained which means I want close racing. What is fun about watching one car stay in the lead the entire race? F1 technology is cool but it has increasingly led to insanely delicate cars in terms of optimum performance. Look at Indy, Alonso couldn't pass Hamilton because he would lose too much grip/downforce while following close enough to pass. When F1 changes the rules in the future, don't think that all of the insane technology we see today is going to disappear. It's going to still be there. It may be focused in other areas than areo packages, but F1 has always been about pushing technology to the limit and it will continue to do so regardless of the rules. Bottom line, F1 in its present form is not a competitive sport. There is one or two teams who dominate the entire season. I want closer racing. I want everyone on the grid to have a chance of winning the race or getting pole position. That just doesn't happen today.,F1 cars are always at the limit of acceptable weight. More costs? F1 is expensive no matter what. AWD could lead to faster cars as they would be able to put down more power sooner coming out of turns. Four wheels break traction less than two. Spec-ing will lead to closer racing.",#8,post: 202084,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1,361","1,023",,,NA

Behar commented: “We are delighted to have six prestigious manufacturers, with a distinguished history in motor sport, joining us for the first full year of the Intercontinental Rally Challenge. Their important participation will ensure a very close competition throughout the year.”,There will also be a battle between three different tyre suppliers - BFGoodrich, Pirelli and Yokohama. This added diversity will lend yet another dimension to the sporting challenge this year.,The series launch took place in the historic city centre of Istanbul, attended by some of the world's leading motor sport media and the president of the Turkish motor sport federation Mumtaz Tahincioglu. Behar added: “The IRC aims to bring a whole new dimension to rallying, by taking the sport to the people in a way that has never been seen before.,We aim to do this through a series of high-quality and innovative television programmes on Eurosport, using live broadcasts, in-car cameras and helicopter cameras. We are very pleased that these six manufacturers have supported our initiative, which is a great step forwards for us in only our first full year of competition.”,The Rally of Turkey gets underway today (Friday) with a ceremonial start in Istanbul city's centre, followed by a spectator superspecial stage. In total the crews will tackle 19 gravel stages before returning to Istanbul for the finish at 1600 on Sunday.,The Intercontinental Rally Challenge is a new nine-round rally series authorized by the FIA, which covers three continents (Africa, Europe and Asia).",#1,,June 5,Australia,Male,Volkswagen Parts Advisor,"1,668",809,"1961 Volkswagen Karmann Ghia Coupé,1993 Volkswagen Golf Cabriolet,2006 Volkswagen Golf 19 TDI Comfortline (family car),2008 Volkswagen Jetta 2.0 FSI Comfortline,1975 Volkswagen Passat LS wagon,2017 Golf Alltrack with Premium pack,Phaeton V10 TDI LWB / 2019 ID R / 2001 W12 Coupe / 1961 Type 3 Cabriolet",,NA

When they are interviewed on TV after the race or at any other time, these guys know how to put a face and a character across that is really appealing. Whether it's all sincere or just put on for the media is beside the point, it works. Many look upon them as role models because of their characters. When The Man in the black number 3 car (Dale Earnhardt) got killed a few years ago and the funeral was held in Charlotte, at least in this area it was like Elvis had died.,When I think of the few Formula 1 drivers like Mika Hakkinen and Kimi Raikkonen, both of whom I had great hopes for both for the track and for being individuals that would positively promote the sport, what comes to mind first is Mika's condescending attitude towards some of his fellow drivers like David Coulthardt and Michael Schumacher(don't care to remember the details) and Kimi's latest one liner that made headlines. Of course Kimi and Mika aren't the only ones who did not know how to put on a face that sells, I have heard others here in the US say the same thing about the F1 drivers not being all that likeable compared to their Nascar counterparts.",#8,,"Apr 29, 1954

The preformance and dominance of the R8 is the stuff of legends. The new R10 seems poised to pick up the baton without losing a beat.,A remarkable engineering achievement, the R10 is the first Diesel to win the 24 hours of LeMans and several ALMS series races in its first year. It is particularly poignant in today's uncertain fossil fuel environment that the R10, an engineering tour de force, uses a more efficient fuel source, achieving outstanding power, fuel economy and reliability.,Oh yeah, did I mention that it keeps winning?,Well, now it seems that the ALMS governing body (and Dyson Racing) want to change the rules to handicap the R 10. It is their hope that allowing Dyson a 65 kg weight allowance and a larger fuel tank will even things up.,Rules be damned, if somebody looks too good, we'll just change them. Audi, a major contributor to the ALMS, and the only major-brand factory team in P1 is understandably upset by this decision.

Motorsports,Question: Why isn't F1 popular in the States ?!,post-110778,"Nov 6, 2006",Osnabrueck,"My dumb explanation is that Americans are only interested in watching Americans do stuff, or maybe Americans beting the crap out of competitors from other countries. Soccer and F1 are dominated by non-Americans, so there's half an answer.,On the other hand, just so happens that only the UK and the British Colonies are interested in Rugby and Cricket. The rest of the world yawns.,And on yet another hand, there's all sorts of sports that are wildly popular in certain regions and are a complete flop in others, so I dunno. Any sociologists in the house?,Maybe an easier answer is that NASCAR is wildly popular in the states - especially amongst the rual/dumbass population. It's so huge, and there's so much money poured into and out of it, there's really not room for another dominant motorsport.,Giving F1 a real shot at the limelight means lots of money, promotion and whatnot. It's a chicken/egg thing that can't work because nobody is going to hang their neck out to promote a sport that'll probably be DOA if it tries to compete with the established Sunday broadcasts.",#6,,"Oct 24, 1977

Motorsports,Kimi to leave Ferrari - reports,post-206464,"Jul 9, 2007",Mr.Link,"My point on Kimi Raikkonen is, He is a Brilliant driver! Agreed he has'nt had a title and in recent times has been all over the negative side but the guy has talent pretty much matched upto the nicest guys on the grid. I think in 2003 he missed out on WDC by 2 points on MS right? A lot of it contributed to un-reliable MCL's and I guess some to his luck/fate and the same happened in the year 2005 which I know Luca di Montezemolo  (apologies for the spelling) has openly said that Kimi would have won if it was not for his un-reliable car. And also Michael while leaving again specified he too was happy with the choice and it was their first and only choice. (I know a lot of these words are probably for PR),Ferrari definately have tons of faith Kimi and as far as I can see I think they would not really look at Alonso as their driver and anything coming from the press about them thinking of sacking kimi or kimi leaving ferrari are just Page 3 stories to fill their empty spaces. I maybe wrong on a lot of all this but Kimi will make his space in one of the greatest F1 drivers and I still want him to go back to Mclaren Mercedes!!,P.S A little offtopic NarutoRamen you like Neha Dhupia?

Motorsports,Hamilton: don’t believe the hype -formula 1-,post-217130,"Aug 10, 2007",hussein,"After days of sensationalist media claims that he is ‘at war’ with McLaren team mate Fernando Alonso, Lewis Hamilton has moved to quell what he insists are misleading stories.,It follows last weekend’s Hungarian Grand Prix, in which Alonso was penalised for impeding Hamilton during qualifying. As a result, the Englishman - who admitted he had disobeyed a team order to move over for the champion during the session - inherited pole position and went on to win the race. Alonso finished only fourth.,Since then, the press - particularly in Britain and Spain - has been full of stories suggesting the drivers are no longer talking. However, Hamilton has now taken the unusual step of releasing a press statement through McLaren to refute the claims once and for all.,“For the record, Fernando and I are fiercely competitive and respectful of each other,” he said. “We are both ambitious drivers who want to win. However, we are not drivers at war, as has been widely reported.,“Although we did not speak on Sunday we have spoken since the weekend and continue to have a professional working relationship. In fact, Fernando and I plan to meet up over the holiday period.”,Hamilton also denied stories suggesting he had used inappropriate language with team boss Ron Dennis and expressed his disappointment that the press had chosen to publish what he described as “inflammatory and untrue material”.,“As an individual in my first year in Formula One I have done my utmost to conduct myself in a professional and open manner,” said Hamilton. “Of course, I have made mistakes, not least during the last weekend, and those are open to public scrutiny. I have my own regrets and have dealt with matters arising.,“However, it is disappointing that inflammatory and untrue material is given to the media and published which may damage reputations. This inflammatory material is then commentated on by many others as if it is factual.,“Whilst I wouldn't normally communicate through press statements, I felt it important to set this matter straight."",Hamilton leads the drivers’ championship by seven points from Alonso",#1,,,BELL CALIFORNIA,NA,you mean my future job = I DUNNO GOOD QUESTION THO,178,37,"ill  get in the future a all new audi rs4,my future car is the 2009 audi rs4",NEVER LET SPEED TAKE OVER YOU,NA
