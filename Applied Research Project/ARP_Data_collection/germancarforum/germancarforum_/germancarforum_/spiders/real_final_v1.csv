Mercedes-Benz,First listening test of the holistic sound production: Electric mobility turns into an acoustic experience,post-996911,"Oct 13, 2020",bialkov,"No V8 rumble, no diesel knock, no turbo slurp – electric cars are quiet by nature. Nonetheless, driving in future Mercedes-Benz EQ model generations will optionally become a multi-sensory experience: the sound experts of Mercedes-Benz are working on making the paradigm shift from combustion model to electric car audible as well.,The listening test in a demo EQC shows what developments they are currently working on: different soundscapes enable an individual acoustic set-up here. The soundscapes can be selected and also switched off via a menu in MBUX on the central display. Over-the-air updates are conceivable in future.,Also part of the particular soundscape is the driving sound, which is reproduced by the speakers in the interior. It awakens emotions and inspires. At the same time the driving sound is interactive, as it responds to a good dozen parameters such as the accelerator position, speed or recuperation. Selection of the drive program likewise influences the driving sound, for example, the sounds become more dynamic in SPORT mode. The technology uses intelligent sound design algorithms to calculate the sounds coming from the amplifier of the Burmester® surround sound system in real time and the loudspeakers to reproduce them.,The holistic sound concept also includes sounds that give the driver feedback – for example, when the car is unlocked, when it can be started or even as a farewell. Connecting the charging plug also is accompanied by acoustic feedback that is intuitive to understand, this time outside the vehicle. For example, the driver can be given an acoustic signal that the charging procedure was successful, and indicating the charge state of the battery.,To reproduce this feedback outside the vehicle, Mercedes-Benz uses the loudspeakers of the Acoustic Vehicle Alert System (AVAS) in the bumpers. This system is mandatory for new electric cars type-approved (homologised) since 1 July 2019. In Europe AVAS must be operational up to a speed of 20 km/h. When driving slowly, it generates an external sound so that pedestrians are aware of the electric car's approach.,The algorithms and sounds for the sound design are created in-house at Mercedes-Benz. In addition to physicists, the interdisciplinary team also includes sound designers, media designers and mechatronics specialists. They work on the emotionalising sound of future Mercedes-Benz EQ models in an acoustic laboratory which is shielded from external noises and vibrations. And they conduct listening tests during test drives of interactive demo vehicles, including at the new Immendingen Test and Technology Centre (TTC).,To achieve a really empathetic relationship between the interaction of the driver and the sound feedback, their work is not just based on musical compositions and harmonies, but also on varying the vibrancy of the soundscape with numerous sound dimensions. This elevates the sound design to a holistic multi-sensory experience that interacts with the whole vehicle. This experience is the contrast between comfortably quiet and precise feedback with emotionally appealing design.,Here are some facts and figures:,[1] The power consumption was determined on the basis of Directive 692/2008/EC. The power consumption is dependent upon the vehicle configuration.

Production is restricted to 75 examples, and even from a distance, it looks as if it means business.,The 75 sits lower than a regular XKR, on stiffer suspension, but appears even more ground-hugging, thanks to its bodykit. This adds a lower front splitter, sill extensions, a neat tail spoiler and 20-inch diamond-cut alloys. All the shiny chrome is black, and the Stratus Grey paint can be adorned with the silver graphics on our car’s wings as an option.,Fire it up, and the newcomer sounds as good as it looks. The supercharged 5.0-litre V8 now produces 523bhp – up by 20bhp – and comes with a new exhaust that adds a wicked, rasping edge to the deep-chested V8. Inside, the XKR 75 gets a combination of piano black trim, dark leather and a midnight black headlining.,As soon as you pull away, you can sense this XK’s steely demeanour. Around town, the suspension relays more detail of the road surface, and the steering has more weight, too. Yet the Jag is as cosseting as ever; the suspension is compliant and the six-speed automatic gearbox is smooth and responsive.,Performance is huge, the V8 delivering a mighty push from modest revs and sustaining it to the red line. It also produces a delicious exhaust crackle when you back off. Low-speed traction is strong, helped by Jaguar’s clever electronically controlled limited slip differential, and the 4.4-second 0-60mph time is quicker than the stock XKR’s.,The top speed is limited to 174mph, as it is on the Speed Pack model. With the traction control turned off, the tail will kick wide, but it’s pretty easy to catch.,At higher speeds, though, the XKR 75 feels planted, with the precision and directness of its steering and the tautness of the suspension inspiring confidence. This slack-free feel is down to some unique suspension components which give enhanced wheel control under pressure.,Not surprisingly, the XKR 75 has posted an impressive lap time at Germany’s legendary Nürburgring circuit; 8m 01 seconds with a little traffic, so sub-eight minutes is feasible. It’s a fitting birthday celebration.",#1,,NA,NA,NA,NA,"11,139","11,209","VW Golf V Variant TDI Bluemotion Sportline,Range Rover TDV8, Bentley Azure T, Bentley Mulsanne, Aston Martin DBS Volante","""Nothing will make a driver more faithful to a car, than a car that is faithful to its driver.""",NA

Motorsports,Analysis - top teams pass notes to improve overtaking,post-335880,"Oct 6, 2008",Family Guy,"The 2009 Formula One season could see a lot more passing manoeuvres thanks to a unique collaboration between three of the sport’s leading teams. Backed by the FIA, top design engineers from Ferrari, McLaren and Renault worked together to help frame changes to the aerodynamic regulations that should make overtaking far less of a rarity.,Under current regulations, a driver typically needs to be as much as two seconds a lap faster than the car in front to have a realistic chance of passing. That should be cut to around a second next year thanks to a host of bodywork changes, including wider front wings that can be adjusted by the driver from the cockpit - a Formula One first.,Instigated by the FIA at the beginning of 2007, the Overtaking Working Group (OWG) - comprising Ferrari’s Rory Byrne, McLaren’s Paddy Lowe and Renault’s Pat Symonds - used McLaren’s advanced Formula One simulator to evaluate overtaking at Turn 1 of the old Barcelona circuit. Having established the existing ‘two seconds per lap’ requirement, they set about cutting that in half through aerodynamic changes.,They quickly learned that previous FIA proposals aimed at increasing overtaking, in particular the planned Centreline Downwash Generating (CDG) rear wing, had some major flaws. Utilising a conventional wind tunnel rather than computer-based Computational Fluid Dynamics, they instead came up with a series of new measures which should guarantee the desired effect.,The most obvious changes to the cars will be a taller and narrower rear wing, a shorter rear diffuser, and the loss of bodywork appendages such as deflectors, winglets and chimneys. Perhaps the most interesting revision, however, is to the front wing, which will become much wider. It will also be Formula One racing’s first (legal) moveable aerodynamic device, with the driver able to fine tune its settings from the cockpit.,“The flap will be controlled and monitored by the standard ECU,” explains OWG member Paddy Lowe. “The software in this unit is FIA-controlled, so it will only allow two adjustments per lap. The number of settings available to the driver will be up to the team, but the maximum flap angle range is +/- 3 degrees (i.e. 6 degrees total), so probably a team might provide one-degree steps.”,Having achieved their target of the ‘one second per lap’ requirement, it remains to be seen how the OWG’s measures will perform during an actual Grand Prix. Have they got the balance right? After all, many will rightly argue that overtaking in Formula One - the world’s premier motorsport series -,be difficult.,“In my view the reduction from two seconds to one is a very big and important step,” says Lowe. “We may indeed find that this is sufficient. Clearly a zero second per lap differential is nonsensical, so it is not as though we only made half the necessary progress! I also do not believe we want to make overtaking trivial if your car is at all faster - i.e. if we reduced that same number to 0.2sec/lap, say, then it would almost guarantee that any faster car could overtake any slower car without delay - a really quite boring prospect.”,It’s clear the changes should make for even more exciting racing, but that doesn’t mean they will make life any easier for the drivers. They already have a myriad of controls to deal with from the cockpit and next year will see the addition of not only adjustable wings but also KERS, the Kinetic Energy Recovery System (which could also boost overtaking).,As Lowe succinctly puts it, “Switch 'real estate' on the steering wheel is becoming as difficult to find as it is in the cockpit of a 747!”",#1,,,"Melbourne, Australia",NA,NA,177,20,Audi R8 V12 TDI,,NA

Motorsports,2011 F1 proposals,post-202556,"Jun 28, 2007",Porsche Guy,"I usually refrain from posting but I feel the need to step in here. What the FIA is proposing is better than what is currently going on in F1.,First off, downforce and drag are directly proportional as drag is a byproduct of downforce. A steeper wing gives more drag and more downfoce. You can't get rid of drag and increase downfoce. It just doesn't work that way. F1 is all about compromise. Do you create extra drag for the sake of downforce or do  you lose grip for better straight line speed? While I like the extremes teams go to create intricate areo packages, they don't give the spectator a close race and since I'm not racing the car, why should I care about this? I want to be entertained which means I want close racing. What is fun about watching one car stay in the lead the entire race? F1 technology is cool but it has increasingly led to insanely delicate cars in terms of optimum performance. Look at Indy, Alonso couldn't pass Hamilton because he would lose too much grip/downforce while following close enough to pass. When F1 changes the rules in the future, don't think that all of the insane technology we see today is going to disappear. It's going to still be there. It may be focused in other areas than areo packages, but F1 has always been about pushing technology to the limit and it will continue to do so regardless of the rules. Bottom line, F1 in its present form is not a competitive sport. There is one or two teams who dominate the entire season. I want closer racing. I want everyone on the grid to have a chance of winning the race or getting pole position. That just doesn't happen today.,F1 cars are always at the limit of acceptable weight. More costs? F1 is expensive no matter what. AWD could lead to faster cars as they would be able to put down more power sooner coming out of turns. Four wheels break traction less than two. Spec-ing will lead to closer racing.",#8,post: 202084,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1,360","1,021",,,NA

Behar commented: “We are delighted to have six prestigious manufacturers, with a distinguished history in motor sport, joining us for the first full year of the Intercontinental Rally Challenge. Their important participation will ensure a very close competition throughout the year.”,There will also be a battle between three different tyre suppliers - BFGoodrich, Pirelli and Yokohama. This added diversity will lend yet another dimension to the sporting challenge this year.,The series launch took place in the historic city centre of Istanbul, attended by some of the world's leading motor sport media and the president of the Turkish motor sport federation Mumtaz Tahincioglu. Behar added: “The IRC aims to bring a whole new dimension to rallying, by taking the sport to the people in a way that has never been seen before.,We aim to do this through a series of high-quality and innovative television programmes on Eurosport, using live broadcasts, in-car cameras and helicopter cameras. We are very pleased that these six manufacturers have supported our initiative, which is a great step forwards for us in only our first full year of competition.”,The Rally of Turkey gets underway today (Friday) with a ceremonial start in Istanbul city's centre, followed by a spectator superspecial stage.

It is particularly poignant in today's uncertain fossil fuel environment that the R10, an engineering tour de force, uses a more efficient fuel source, achieving outstanding power, fuel economy and reliability.,Oh yeah, did I mention that it keeps winning?,Well, now it seems that the ALMS governing body (and Dyson Racing) want to change the rules to handicap the R 10.
