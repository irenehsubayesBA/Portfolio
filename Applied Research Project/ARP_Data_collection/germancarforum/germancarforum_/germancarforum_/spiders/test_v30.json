The previous decade was much worse and the quality wasn't even as good. The old A-Class was rubbish. It seriously amazes me how some people are able to keep trashing the current lineup when the previous generation included the old A Class. Is this really what you would call confident, smart styling? No. And the fact that it wasn't heavily changed when the FL season came around doesn't make anyone appreciate MB more.", "There were other flubs back then too. In terms of the SUV lineup, the ML had the ghastly razor-grille thing, and the GL is no where near as high-quality and gracious as it is now. For that part of the lineup, I think that there is a definite improvement from before. The C-Class, as it is as W204, should go down into history as a classic. I'm not saying that the previous generation wasn't good or anything, but clearly the new iteration is a very respectable design, if not a better one.", "Then comes the higher-end side of things. The new CLS seems to be very controversial. While I don't think it is necessarily the best example of perfect design exercise, there is definitely HUGE appeal in the car, and besides the lines, is very nice to look at. Nobody can speak for the W222 yet, though from what I've seen, should look at the very least 'alright'. Then there's the SL and the SLK. These two roadsters are plagued by weak and bloated front-ends which are adorned with bulky headlights. However, the SL manages to look decent with the AMG pack, and the SLK has a powerful rear-end itself. Again, very questionable, and weak designs, but still not as terrible as everyone seems to feel about it.", "It's funny how members of this forum say that the radical changes during the facelift season is THE result for the declining sales at Mercedes. Off the top of my head, the C-Class seems to have had the most extensive facelift, though even that one wasn't really major. In terms of what was changed in the exterior, I think we can all agree that it was typical facelift-fair. Changes to the lights, minor changes to the graphics, and maybe new options for rims. What really changed was the interior, which", "changing.", "The reason why there was declining sales before this fact was likely because the pre-fl W204 had a weak interior. The materials were cheap, and the austere design did not appeal to many people. This was likely more representative of the declining sales at MB MORE than the 'butt-hurt buyer' syndrome. The same thing applies to the W212. As much as it is a success in the States, the design (both interior and out) is what was driving customers away.", "Think about it. If we look at the worldwide sales of MB for 2012, we're dealing with a consumer market which has likely NOT seen the fl W212 yet. There is no reason for there to be a decline in image from the \"slapping of the face for previous mb owners\"; the car hasn't even been released yet! There is ony one reason for the loss of market share at MB. It is because the previous generation wasn't good enough. Mercedes has no time to waste. If it waits until the design cycle is over just to avoid hurting previous customers, it will serve as a risk in their momentum and strategy. Whether or not their ventures were successful is a different issue, but the idea is that radical action needed to be taken in some way."], "post_order": "#63", "replier_post_ID": [], "user_location": "NA", "user_gender": "NA", "user_occupation": "NA", "user_messages_count": "923", "user_reaction_score": "526", "user_mygarage": []},
