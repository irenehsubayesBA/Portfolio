Global,EVO: Maserati Quattroporte Sport GT S,post-269204,"Jan 17, 2008",Bartek S.,"This is the most driver-orientated Quattroporte yet, but the visual clues are restrained. This is a good thing. Subtle yet imposing, elegant yet athletic, Maserati’s saloon is one of those cars that deserves to live its life unmolested by the revisionist stylist’s pen. That said, other areas have offered scope for improvement and, happily, it’s these that the Sport GT S addresses.,We tried Maserati’s first stab at a sportier Quattroporte, the Sport GT, back in issue 092 and concluded that ‘Skyhook’ adaptive damping doesn’t combine well with 20in wheels and lower profile tyres. It’s absent on the Sport GT S, replaced by conventional, single-rate Bilstein dampers, but the 20s remain – now with even wider, 295-section rear tyres – and are combined with shorter and stiffer springs that lower the car by 10mm at the front and 25mm at the rear. Visually the set-up works a treat, especially in combination with the black-chrome side-window surrounds and tailpipes, body-colour door handles and smoke-chrome alloys.,You’d think the GT S would be perfectly suited to the ‘DuoSelect’ paddle-shift automated manual gearbox, but Maserati knows which way the wind is blowing. It finally gave the Quattroporte a proper automatic gearbox early in 2007 (evo 103), and this, exclusively, is what the GT S comes with. In less than a year the conventional ZF six-speed auto has marginalised DuoSelect – currently more than 70 per cent of Quattroporte buyers specify the ZF, and that figure is still rising. Maserati predicts that next year only one in five Quattroportes will be DuoSelects.,The final dynamic element of the GT S package is new Brembo front brakes with six-piston callipers (up from four) and 360mm diameter discs that weigh the same as the previous 330mm items, something that has been achieved by having a cast iron disc ‘dual-cast’ with a hub carrier of aluminium alloy – a first for a road car.,Given that the Sport GT S is lower and has 25 per cent stiffer springs, the expectation is that the ride will feel a little resilient around town, yet this isn’t the case. Yes, there’s firm wheel control, but never to the point of harshness. The further you drive, the more impressive it is, the GT S feeling taut and alert for a car of its size but with just the right degree of suppleness too.,Inside it’s as welcoming and stylish as ever, this interpretation of the theme defined by carbonfibre fillets and Alcantara for the steering-wheel, gear selector and the centres of the ‘sportier’ seats, which still feel a size too big for sub-plutocrats.,As we’ve reported before, the auto ’box makes city work the doddle it always ought to have been and responds keenly to downshift demands via the throttle or the tactile paddles (standard on the GT S). In its programming it’s perhaps not as intuitive as the ZF in the Jaguar XK, and in this sporty setting it would be good if opting for manual selection via the paddles meant you got only that, so you could find the limiter at the red line rather than an upshift.,With 339lb ft and 396bhp up against almost 2000kg, it’s a quick car but not strikingly so. You really want a bit more grunt, too, not so much to deal more decisively with turbodiesels on the autostrada but to more fully exploit the chassis on a twisty road.,The steering feels a fraction light about the straight-ahead, requiring a bit more concentration at motorway speeds than expected, but guiding the Quattroporte into inviting corners it feels nicely weighty, smooth and direct. Indeed, there’s a satisfying poise and quality to the GT S’s demeanour, a consistency that encourages you to press on. A little more steering feel would be welcome, but when you do find a corner where you can push really hard, the GT S slips gently through cautioning mild understeer into progressive, catchable and gatherable oversteer.,It would have been great to have had the opportunity to interrogate the chassis more fully, and get the new brakes up to temperature, but the test route (alongside Lake Garda – beautiful, but slow) didn’t allow it. Even so, I’m pretty confident that for the keener driver, the Sport GT S offers the best Quattroporte chassis yet, a set-up that doesn’t so much trade comfort for precision as offer big, satisfying chunks of both. More than ever, what Maserati needs now is a bigger, brawnier version of the characterful V8, or maybe a compact V12…",#1,,,"Montreal, Canada",Male,Veterinarian,"8,433","8,864","2019 M640 GT, 2020 440ix cabrio, 2019 Ford 250, e-Golf,2008 M5,Mercedes ONE, Taycan turbo S","Married, 4 kids,,Motorsport, horses,M -No more the most powerful letter in the world",NA

A Quattroporte wouldn't really be for me, even if I had the money - I prefer something a little more.. German, if you wish - but I still give it respect!,I suppose I would have chosen a slightly darker exterior colour - to show off those curves more.  Colours too close to black and too close to white seem to hide contours more than intermediate colours, especially metallic and pearlescent paints.  Perhaps something with slightly more ivory might be nice, or indeed, the colour of that Aston.,As for the interior, it's impressive!  I like it a lot.  The rich brown upholstery is just the shade I like, and without that too-shiny look that makes me dislike leather (though it could just be the lighting).  The piano black goes perfectly with the black dash top - provides an interesting point of contrast in texture without being crass (carbon fibre), brash (aluminium) or boringly traditional (woodgrain).,Woodgrain suits some cars, but not the Q'porte Sport GT.  Why get the sporty variant if you're going to do it up like any other luxury car?  Not to mention you've got the Phaeton for that.  Similarly, I like the wheels and the red brake calipers.

Global,Maserati GranTurismo: Sex appeal on wheels,post-274480,"Feb 5, 2008",far2000,"[image no longer available],By Michael Booth,Cars and sex: it's time to confess. I've never really grasped the connection.,I can see how a Corvette's wavy waist is supposed to evoke a reclining woman or that the Edsel Ford's face, for some reason probably connected with its designer's disturbed id, was designed to look like a lady's, er, feminine bits.,I can even, at a stretch, kind of see how people think an E-Type is phallic (I have yet to see a penis with headlamps and a number plate – but perhaps I just don't go to the right clubs).,But as far as actually using a car to get sex, I haven't figured that one out, I'm afraid,. Dangle your Ferrari key fob at the nightclub bar? Flirt while driving? Think of the logistics!,No, that only really happens in Elvis movies and, frankly, Elvis could have flirted successfully while entombed within an iron maiden.,But then the new Maserati GranTurismo appeared outside my door. It certainly had its wicked way with me. I was instantly transformed into one of those sex-crazed wolves from old Warner Brothers cartoons, my eyes bursting out of my skull on stalks, my tongue unfurling like a red carpet.,I haven't slobbered that much since I had root canal surgery. I simply could not take my eyes off the thing.,If any car is going to turn you into a red-hot, foxy love god, it's one of these Ferrari V8-engined babies (see, I'm already using the word ""babies"" as if I were some kind of porn actor),.,No wonder there's a year's waiting list.,Fiat, which took over the running of the company from Ferrari in 2007, is talking about sales hitting 10 000 by 2009 and Maserati, helped by a triumphant return to the American market, is making a profit for the first time since Fangio's day.,The night it arrived my wife came over all affectionate for the first time since Gordon Brown took office. It was definitely the GranTurismo I had to thank.,It's obscene in a good way – the raunchiest amalgam of metal, glass, rubber and leather since Cher straddled an aircraft carrier. If you stand next to one while holding its key, I promise you can't help but become sexier by proxy.,This is amazing because the R1.7-million GranTurismo is actually quite a fatty, bulging over the boundaries of even the most generous parking space, like Aretha Franklin in hot pants.,It carries it well, though. It has the coiled sensual grace of a horny otter and, with a top speed of almost 290km/h, the performance to match.,So the Maserati is the kind of car to make a man of, well, even me. It's the kind of car that one can, for instance, all too easily imagine Nicolas Sarkozy ordering to amuse and impress Carla Bruni.,Now there's a man who needs to get himself a GranTurismo.

It has been talking about a new subbrand called Blue that could support fully electric versions of the rumored Alfieri sports car, Quattroporte sedan, and Levante SUV. However, now the Italian automaker is getting more specific, announcing that it has started testing its first all-electric powertrain to be introduced in the new GranTurismo and GranCabrio sports cars.,It hasn't released specifications for this electric powertrain yet, though we expect it to help propel the new GranTurismo and GranCabrio much quicker than its internal-combustion-engined predecessor, which launched to 60 mph in the mid-four-second range. The electric vehicles' sound is also being developed at the facility in Modena, Italy.,The GranTurismo was unveiled at the 2007 Geneva auto show and was produced until November 2019. Maserati also recently announced that a new two-seat sports car is coming, which we originally thought would be the highly anticipated Alfieri that was revealed in 2014, but now we're skeptical of this because of the mid-engine mule we recently saw. We could also see a hybrid version of the Ghibli sedan and a second SUV beneath the Levante in the near future, too.,And, at a recent drive event in Colorado, Maserati representatives repeatedly mentioned a big product announcement coming in May 2020 but wouldn’t provide any additional details.

The mods add about 48 extra mm (2 inches) to the car’s total length.,It also sits closer to the ground than the regular GranTurismo S and on top of that it will also max out at 303 km/h (188 mph), which is pretty impressive.,In terms of acceleration, the MC Stradale will hit 100 km/h (62 mph) in 4.5 seconds – which to be fair isn’t mind bending anymore but it will surely get the job done.,As for the looks, well, this was already one of the world’s best looking coupes so the fact that they strapped on a set of Vossen Forged VPS-306 wheels is even more of a good thing. The VPS-306 series wheels are the same ones we saw on this Mercedes AMG GT S, except that in a different color.,Bottom line, what’s not to love about this car?

Global,Maserati Quattroporte (VI),post-610820,"Dec 4, 2012",Monteverdi,"Maserati begins a three-year product offensive with a bigger, better Quattroporte featuring a mighty new Ferrari-built turbo V8,It’s well past time for an all-new new Maserati Quattroporte. The existing car, although beautiful, has been around more or less unaltered for eight years, which is too long for for most limos. But now there’s an all-new edition, revealed last week in Los Angeles and due to reach its first European mainland customers in February and UK buyers next June.,Most cars use carry-over pieces, but this new Maser is just about as new as a new car can get: it has a different look, an all-new platform, newly designed engines by Ferrari (entirely different in character to the old ones), considerably different dimensions and even a new role in the marque’s future line-up. To cap everything, its launch begins a new phase in the company’s history, one aimed at massively boosting total sales from last year’s 6200 units to 50,000 units by 2015.,The new Quattroporte grows to the length of a standard Mercedes-Benz S-class, and whereas it was once cramped in the rear, it is now as roomy inside as the Merc is. The boot is now vast, too. Buyers get a choice of two new Ferrari-designed and built twin-turbocharged, direct injection petrol engines, a 3.8-litre V8 with 523 bhp and a 3.0-litre V6 with 407 bhp, both of which drive through an eight-speed ZF gearbox. Our test car was a V8.,Optional four-wheel drive (which usually directs 100 per cent of the drive to the rear in dry conditions, but can split it as far as 50 per cent front, 50 per cent rear) is available in many markets although not the UK, while a high-performance diesel, already a certainty in the forthcoming 5-series-size Maserati Ghibli, is under consideration. The chassis is a steel monocoque with aluminium forgings and castings for components such as crossmembers and suspension parts, where lightness really counts. The new all-independent suspension (double wishbone front, five-link rear) will be used in other new-era models.,The Quattroporte’s styling was created in-house. It carries the already-established family look with a classic, vertically slatted grille, luxuriously sculpted sides and a neatly tapered rear, although its greater rear bulk means it lacks some of the outgoing car’s delicacy and is remionisecnt, some say, of the look of an Infiniti or a Lexus. Such is the price of a decent amount of rear cabin space.,The interior theme is simplification, with quality, and it works very well. There’s a straightforward twin-dial fascia set-up straight ahead, with a small screen between the dials and a three-spoke wheel that perfectly splits the difference between luxurious and sporty. The central console is satisfyingly high, with the main info screen just above it. The tan all-leather seats have traditionally styled ribbed inserts that look beautiful and feel supportive.,Any fear you may have had about the car’s size impinging on its driving quality dissolves the moment you close the driver’s door. The seats hold your body well, and the driving position, low and long, feels ideal for concentrated driving. The silky engine starts smoothly and there’s barely a hint of a V8 throb, though something warns you about the 500-plus horsepower on tap. The excellent ZF transmission (specially adapted to this 1900kg, paddle-shifted application) does its stuff as beautifully as ever, and there’s a lightning responses through its accelerator that feels all-Italian.,It’s restrained fun driving the Quattroporte for smoothness, but for all its refinement this car fairly itches to hurl you down the road, especially if you allow it anywhere near the exalted 7200rpm redline. Under five seconds for the 0-62mph sprint is a helluva time for a two-tonne super-saloon: plenty of supercars do no better. Nor can they touch its 190mph top speed. In fact, for a while it’s tough working out what kind of engine this truly is: is it a torquey, low-revving V8 or a high-revving, smaller-capacity turbo? Truth is, it’s both.,It’s tough, trying to reach conclusions about a luxury limo’s ride comfort while driving Fiat’s Balocco test track, as we did. The place is all about near-limit handling, where this car excels. Given the long wheelbase, grippy tyres (and surface) and subtle intrusions of the sweetly-tuned chassis's stability control, the Quattroporte stays neutral in corners to the point of insanity, when you start to notice a whiff of stabilising understeer and a little body roll. Oversteer isn’t really on the agenda. The steering is accurate and perfectly weighted, though I did think I noticed a hint of vagueness on lock, away from the straight-ahead.,And the ride? My best guess it’s on the firm side of supple, possibly unyielding enough to cause sticky moments on poor UK roads. We look forward to checking thoroughly.,£100,000 (est);,4.7sec;,191mph;,23.7mpg (combined);,278 g/km;,1900kg;,V8 petrol, twin turbo, direct injection, 3798cc;,Front, rear-wheel-drive;,523bhp @ 6800rpm;,479lb ft (530lb ft overboost) at 2000-4000rpm;,8-spd auto;,80 litres;,530 litres;,Alloy, 20in,http://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/first-drives/first-drive-review-maserati-quattroporte-v8",#84,,NA,NA,NA,NA,160,332,,,NA

Global,From Spied to Official: Maserati MC20 Supercar,post-757886,"Aug 6, 2015",Heisenberg,"The Maserati Alfieri concept was one of the stars of the 2014 Geneva Motor Show, so we were thrilled when it showed up in company's five year plan a few months later.  That enthusiasm has led our artists to create a rendering of what the production model could look like when it is introduced in 2016 or 2017.,Considering that several executives have already said the production model will closely resemble the concept, it comes as little surprise that the rendering is instantly recognizable and only features a few modifications including restyled headlights, larger mirrors and more traditional door handles.,Maserati hasn't said much about the car lately but it is slated to be offered as a coupe and convertible.  The company's five year plan also revealed the Alfieri will be offered with rear- and all-wheel drive as well as a V6 engine that has outputs of 410 PS (301 kW), 450 PS (331 kW) and 520 PS (382 kW).,Maserati Alfieri rendered in production guise",#51,,,Earth,Male,NA,327,521,,"The distinction between past, present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion",NA

Global,From Spied to Official: Maserati MC20 Supercar,post-687573,"Mar 24, 2014",Foxfire,"I don't think that's the case... according to reports it's based on a shortened GranTurismo platform (per Wikipedia:,). With a 24 cm shorter wheelbase and such short overhangs, it's almost certainly almost 30 cm shorter than GranTurismo, if not shorter. That's more than a whole class of car shorter. Which I don't mind at all, I just hope the GT chassis still is still modern enough to do this car justice.,EDIT: According to this source:,it is 4590mm long, vs. 4881mm for GranTurismo, or 291mm difference. That's more than the difference between Cayman & 911. Actually Alfieri concept is almost the exactly the same length as a 991 type 911",#37,,,Croatia,NA,NA,422,62,BMW X5 (E70),,NA

Global,From Spied to Official: Maserati MC20 Supercar,post-988350,"Aug 15, 2020",Bridster,"The proportions seem good, the details seem a bit meh, but it's hard to say for sure having only the camo photos to judge.,As for the question of weight, I think those who are hoping for ~1450kg kerb weight are gonna be disappointed. I am very much in the ~1600kg camp. People underestimate how much increase in weight there is with increase in power. You need bigger radiators for the water, bigger radiators for the oil, bigger intercoolers if you have turbos, more heat insulation around the car, the drivetrain components need to thicker and heavier (mostly to do with torque, which this car is also gonna have loads of) - and because of all the extra weight you picked up, now other components on the car get heavier. The fixings, suspension, brakes, maybe the chassis even. The engine might only be a 3L V6, but at 220kg it's not the lightest engine ever and you are also using a heavy DCT. It has a carbon tub, sure, but that alone doesn't guarantee light weight - ie. Lamborghini Aventador.,I think there is some chance it could be around 1450kg, but for that to happen they would have to go balls to the wall with lighweighting and the car would have to be pretty small and fairly stripped. Considering the likely price point, though, and the fact it's likely gonna have many GT features and comforts, ~1600kg seems like the more realistic possibility.",#227,,NA,NA,NA,NA,943,"1,592",,,NA
