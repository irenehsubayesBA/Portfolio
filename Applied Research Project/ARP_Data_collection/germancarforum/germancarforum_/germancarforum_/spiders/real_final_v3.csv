In a speech to industry executives Wednesday at the Center for Automotive Research's 41st annual Management Briefing Seminars, Fields pledged to accelerate Ford's Way Forward plan - increasing the pace of new product introductions and ramping up investment in R&D and flexible manufacturing facilities.,""We'll have more to say on the specifics of what we're accelerating in September. But I can confirm that our plans include more new products, features and technologies throughout our lineup,"" said Fields. ""We have nine new Ford and Lincoln Mercury products going on sale in the next six months alone, and we are rebuilding our business for the future with an emphasis on new products."",More after the jump...On the new product front, Fields highlighted the new Ford Shelby GT (on sale in January), and the Lincoln's new flagship MKS sedan (due in 2008), and nine new Ford and Lincoln Mercury vehicles hitting the market in the next six months, including the Ford Edge and Lincoln MKX crossovers in November.,Technology tidbits from Field's speech include the capless fuel filler (shown at right) that debuted on the Ford GT and will become standard across the Ford lineup, starting with the Lincoln MKS. Ford will also accelerate introduction of iPod connectivity, DVD-based nav systems, and satellite radio - all in response to market demand. Fields also pledged ""more standard safety equipment on more vehicles."",On the investment front, Fields said the company is looking at a potential $1 billion investment in partnership with the state of Michigan, to expand flexible manufacturing at several Ford facilities in the state, and for R&D, particularly in the areas of advanced powertrain technologies and hybrid vehicles.,Expect to hear more on the new product theme in the next installment of "","" this Sunday, when the company will reveal full details of the new Ford Shelby GT.,[Source: Ford]",#1,,"Apr 8, 1977

I love cars for cars, I love what each car maker brings to the table to improve the industry.  So don't think that I am Toyota/Lexus fanatic because I defended them.  I defended them because it is a naive comment to simply say ""they are crap"".  No offence Yannis, but look past the end of your nose.,I could careless if a car company doesn't have history and heritage.  In terms of sales, Lexus have proved in the US market that buyers simply don't hold history and heritage in the same regard as you.  Yes its a niceity, but there isn't any rule to say they can't be good car makers.  Oh and what about car makers that do have heritage and history and have bombed? like rover.,Lexus have increased competition which has forced the BMW/Audi/Merc to lower their prices considerably.  Without Lexus, the Germans simply could have astronomical prices in non-european countries like New Zealand.  This has allowed us everyday people to drive these cars everyday.  This is part of the reason why I have the utmost respect for Lexus.,This is not to offend you but to remind you Yannis:  Remember back in the old GCF days where Brian (creator/owner of GCF) outwardly said that he,due to you bias towards Audi.  And Brian is arguably the biggest german car fanatic.  Now this wasn't to attack your character, but to say ""Yannis, stop being so narrow-minded and look at the wider picture"".

In fact, the farthest anyone got was seven miles, with most of the teams not even getting off the starting line.,Eighteen months later, with the prize money doubled, they tried again, and this time a team from Stanford University finally succeeded (along with three other teams), and completed a 132-mile course from Barstow, California to Primm, Nevada. The Stanford team equipped a Red-Bull sponsored Volkswagen Touareg, nick-named Stanley, with more computer power than the Apollo moon missions, and the SUV ran the distance in a little over 7 seven hours with no human intervention once the race began. In November, DARPA will try again, this time with an,. Instead of a desert course, the teams will traverse a sixty-mile mock urban environment. For this year's event, Stanford has created Junior, a VW Passat wagon packed with laser rangefinders, radar, GPS, and enough Intel Core 2 Duo processors to power a small data center.

Toyota,Toyota caught out cheating with their new Lexus IS-F racer,post-270399,"Jan 22, 2008",monaroCountry,"Remember that luscious Lexus IS-F racer study that received its fair share of unrequited attention the Tokyo Auto Salon? According to AutoBild, it turns out the car isn't an IS-F racer at all -- well, at least not beyond the hood and fact that it has four doors. The German paper reports that the car is actually a Lexus reskin of a 2004 Opel Vectra DTM racer (above, top). Even the engine is from the Opel DTM car, and not a Toyota V8. This could explain why no one at the Lexus stand at the salon would say a word about the car.,So Lexus might get away with never claiming it was a Lexus... cough, cough... but it's a bit odd that they would let Winding Road get the idea that it's the pet project of the IS-F's chief engineer, designed to show the true potential of Lexus' hot sedan and ""something of what a full race IS-F might just feel like."" Perhaps what a full-race IS-F might look like. Unless Lexus really intends for a full-race IS-F to feel like a 4-year-old Opel.,Thanks for the tip, Georg!",#1,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5,4,,,NA

As far as business success at selling cars, and money in the Bank, let alone bad management decisions, (Daimler/Chrysler and BMW/Rover) I think Lexus/Toyota could probably buy out both BMW and Mercedes if it were inclined to do so.,Certainly it is arguably by far the more successful car manufacturing corporation IMHO.,Possibly true, but this is planet earth, and not fortress Europe Christian.,Brand prestige matters to car snobs, fan boys and the marketing companies who create those perspectives and brand 'image'.,The realist looks at pragmatic reality, and here the Germans often come up rather short when compared objectively to the Japanese opposition, where things like quality and reliability matter in the buying equation.,Just being the devils advocate here, and not making an attack of any kind BTW.,But I think an dispassionate viewpoint will reveal that the Japanese are typically rather good at what they do, and they don't need marketing hubris to convey that.,You have a marked talent for photography and car reviews Christian, but i do think it is time for you to travel further afield than reviewing Mercs my friend.

In short run they may face some backlash from customers who switched from other brands but the core customer may forget and forgive because of the high reputation of Toyota that is gained over many decades. It is really amazing that Toyota builds so many units of so models but their quality reputation was intact until recently. It shows that their systems and stratgies are very effective. It might be that the pressure to become number one quickly may have overlook some of the quality standards in their new cars.,Brands are not built overnight and similarly the competitve advantage they gain over the years make them afloat in the bad times too.

The sport was more about scary machines, running on huge tyres, in dangerous conditions, with drivers having huge physical abilities, in machines that were monstruous and powerful. Today F1 is sanitized, clean, and almost quiet, with cars driven by tender teenagers, and until last year, with races that were not played by overtaking, but rather pit stops, regulations, fuel, tyres, and everything else that requires calculations and strategy rather than pure hardcore racing which in my humble opinion isn't as attractive.
