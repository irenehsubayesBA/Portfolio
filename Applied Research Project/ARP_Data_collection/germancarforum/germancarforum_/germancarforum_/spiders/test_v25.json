{"section_name": "Mercedes-Benz", "thread_title": "Modern classics: the S-Class Saloons of the Mercedes-Benz 140 series (1991 to 1998)", "post_ID": "post-464225", "post_date": "May 28, 2010", "post_username": "MBFanToDeath", "post_text": ["The 140 series S-Class Saloons gave a clear  message when they were  introduced in 1991: their size and design lent  them an imposing  appearance, combined with highest comfort and lavish  interior  spaciousness. Certainly these attributes are appropriate to a   Mercedes-Benz S-Class. And yet this model series was anything but   undisputed when it came out: critics complained it had turned out too   big, which brought disadvantages in everyday use, and on top of that was   out of step with the times. Such opinions were voiced mainly in  Europe.  In the USA or in Asia, for example, many customers took exactly  the  opposite view. For them, the 140 series was an S-Class in exactly  the  right format – precisely because of its impressive appearance,  which to  them was simply befitting of a vehicle in which the world’s  successful,  wealthy and political leaders could either drive themselves  or be  driven. This divergence of opinions was to accompany the saloons  of the  140 model series from that point on, and the successor series  launched  in 1998, the 220, turned out rather more discreet.  Nevertheless, the 140  series received a great deal of praise from all  sides. In 1991, for  example, the trade magazine Auto, Motor und Sport,   Germany, went as far as to write: “It would not be wrong here to   describe this as the world’s finest car – any less would be to do   Mercedes an injustice.”", "The world’s finest car – that is quite a claim.  But it is one  Mercedes-Benz and its predecessor brands have been living  up to since  the beginnings of the automobile. For the 140 series the  engineers and  designers addressed the task with the greatest dedication.  Leaving  aside the sheer dimensions of the body, one has to give great  credit to  the stylists under the supervision of chief designer Bruno  Sacco: what  they drafted was a luxury-class saloon with clear lines that   unmistakably established its connection with brand history, yet at the   same time delivered a statement for the 1990s and were almost timeless   in character. Almost twenty years on, a 140 series S-Class is still an   extremely handsome car.", "The high standard applied to the vehicle was  reflected in all  details. For instance, the interior, so lavishly  appointed,  simultaneously demonstrated the restraint desired by the  majority of  S-Class customers. Spaciousness and features made the time  spent in a  140 series S-Class an absolute enjoyment. That was also true  of the  driver’s seating position: perfectly equipped, it made even  extremely  long journeys exceedingly pleasurable.", "The suspension also played a part in this. The  engineers used all  their resourcefulness and skill to design it: not  only was travel in  the saloon extremely safe on any road surface, it was  also extremely  comfortably. In addition to excellent springing, the  body was decoupled  from audible and otherwise perceptible vibrations.  And although the  140 series S-Class was a big car, customers and motor  journalists all  over the world nevertheless praised it for its road  manners – it was  fleet-footed and able to negotiate even winding country  roads  impeccably at speed.", "Typical of the great effort invested by  Mercedes-Benz in this  vehicle, for example, was the double insulated  glazing, which benefited  safety and comfort in several ways: avoidance  of fogging  (condensation) and icing, enhanced thermal insulation,  enhanced  insulation against external sources of noise, better flow of  air around  the vehicle and prevention of wind noises caused by window  seals.  Never before had car windows been so meticulously designed.", "The high safety standard already attained in the  previous series was  clearly raised further by numerous measures. For  example, the body  structure of the 140 series afforded still more  protection in all types  of accidents. A number of details – solutions  designed to take the  sharpness out of potential points of contact –  served the protection of  other road users as well. The braking system  was state-of-the-art,  delivering optimum deceleration values. From 1995  onwards the  Electronic Stability Program ESP® was additionally  available, initially  for the eight-cylinder S-Class model and later for  all models with  automatic transmission. In the S 600 it was standard  equipment. After  December 1996 all models additionally featured the  Brake Assist BAS,  which optimally increased braking power under  emergency braking and  shortened the stopping distance.", "As was customary in the S-Class, six- and  eight-cylinder engines  were available to power the car – from 1991 on  there was even a  twelve-cylinder power plant. This unit epitomised the  art of engine  making, but the other units too enabled a mobility ideally  suited to  the Mercedes-Benz S-Class. All were fitted as standard with  an emission  control system featuring a closed-loop catalytic converter,  and  consequently satisfied comprehensive environmental standards.", "At the same time these engines were symbols of  the longevity of the  140 series – they, and, of course, the entire  vehicle, were designed  for very high mileages and thus for years and  years of use. That made  the 140 series S-Class well suited for use as a  modern classic: anyone  who buys one today, acquires a vehicle built to  meet the highest  requirements. In that sense it is part of the  remarkable tradition of  the luxury-class saloons of the Mercedes-Benz  brand, which together  with its predecessor brands goes back to the  beginnings of the  automobile.", "Mercedes-Benz’s excellent spare parts supply has  helped maintain a  modern classic: almost every part can be procured  through a  Mercedes-Benz dealer and the company’s own ordering system;  delivery is  usually made overnight. Some authorised service shops have  even been  designated Classic Partners, possessing outstanding competence  in  handling older vehicles. And particularly where young classics are   concerned, all Mercedes-Benz company-owned sales and service outlets and   partners boast the same high levels of expertise as ever. Not for   nothing does the slogan “Service for a lifetime” apply to all vehicles   of the brand.", "45 photos", "© 2010 The World Of Mercedes-Benz /////AMG. All rights reserved.", "© 2010 Daimler AG.

At that time the V12 was producing about 355PS (261kW) which is considerably less than the production versions 408PS (300kW) when it came out in 1991.", "But at the same time Mercedes had a V16 on the drawing board as rumours (and later shown) of prototypes of a BMW E32 fitted with a 6.7ltr V16 were circulating in the motoring world. The BMW engine was basically meant as an answer to the Mercedes V12, it was the 5.0ltr V12 with additional 4 cylinders added that produced 6651cm3, power of 414PS (304kW) and 625nm of torque, capable of 0-100km/h in approx. 6.0sec and a delimited top speed of 175mph (282km/h). The BMW engine was so large for its engine bay that the radiators had to be fitted in the boot, so the car effectively had no luggage capacity.", "The Mercedes V16 would be the same concept as that of BMW by adding 4 cylinders onto the M120 6.0ltr V12 to produce an engine with 8.0ltr capacity. This would have been used for a super W140 S-class badged 800SE/SEL. Mercedes only built 3 to 5 prototype engines compared to 15 been rumored to be built by BMW. The 8.0ltr V16 would have produced a massive 540PS (397kW), which would have been nearly 100kW more than the 6.0ltr V12 in the W140 600SEL and even more power than the current 6.0ltr Bi-Turbo V12 with 530PS (390kW) in the 2015 W222 S600!!!", "But unfortunately for both BMW and Mercedes their V16 engines never made it into production possibly due to the huge size and massive cost."], "post_order": "#11", "replier_post_ID": []},
